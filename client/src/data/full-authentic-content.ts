SPEAKER_00:
Harper Audio presents My House of Memories by Merle Haggard with Tom Carter and read by Merle Haggard. 

I've had a blessed life, despite many lows, many of which were of my own doing. There have been times when I simply could not see the light at the end of the economic, romantic, psychological, or emotional tunnel. I've lived through 17 stays in penal institutions, incarceration in state prison, five marriages, bankruptcy, a broken back, brawls, shooting incidents, swindlings, sickness, the death of loved ones, and more.

And I've heard 10,000 chant my name when I couldn't hear the voice of my own soul. And I wondered if God was listening, and I was sure that no one else was. My unhappiness at times was so overwhelming, if anyone had ever told me that I'd be as content as I am today, I would have thought they were talking about someone else.

So I decided to share what has worked for me, knowing it'll work for others. I'm a little embarrassed about some of the stories I'm gonna tell. They're more like confessions than mere reporting of events. And I really can't tell you how high I've been unless I tell you how low I sunk.

Today at times I have peace of mind, the love of God, a good woman, and a family. Today I'm on track, or at least that's what they tell me. Welcome to my world. Enter through the gate of my house of memories.

People milled nervously, fidgeting and looking at their feet the way folks do when embarrassed or angry. They gawked at what they probably thought was a madman in swimming trunks on a mammoth boat in front of them. He was yelling profanities that echoed across northern California's sprawling Lake Shasta for hundreds of yards, as sound does on water.

Shut up, Grandma. I'm busy, he hollered. Shut up. I'll be there in a minute. Damn it, shut up. The onlookers stared in disbelief. Perhaps the man was drunk. Perhaps he was high. No matter. No one had the right, the crowd obviously thought, to talk to his grandmother that way. The man on the boat stepped way over the line.

Screw you, Grandma, he yelled. Suddenly, he noticed the crowd gathering before the boat, tied up at Silverthorne Resort Marina near Jones Valley, and he smiled sheepishly. No one smiled back.

Oh, no, he said with disgust. You think I'm talking to my grandmother. The expressionless people continued their silent vigil. Decent people hate people who abuse their elders almost as much as they hate those who abuse children.

It's not what you think, the man on the boat tried to explain. Wait till I show you. He dropped below the deck, sounded like a man yelling from inside a cave. The onlookers could still hear him snapping at Grandma.

Eventually, he emerged from the boat with a teacup poodle. This, he said, holding up the canine, is Grandma. The people looked at each other and then back at him. This really is Grandma, he insisted. No one spoke. It was clear they thought he was the vilest man on earth, or at least on Lake Shasta.

The hostile group didn't appear to buy the yarn that he had a dog named Grandma. Still the man stood there holding the hapless dog in the air, its limp tongue hanging out of its toothless mouth. The sight of the pitiful pooch did not bolster the man's credibility.

Everyone in the crowd would later tell friends about the creep at the marina. They had seen Freddy Powers, my long-time songwriting partner who shared a houseboat next to mine, from about 1982 until about 1988. He really was yelling at a little dog that had been abandoned by its owner and had wandered its way into our party.

And we paid substantially to have its teeth pulled and bones repaired. The veterinarian said without dental work, the dog would have died from infection. Freddy saved the dog's life by subsidizing its medical care, but his kindness toward the pooch had backfired on him that day at Silverthorne Resort.

In those days, if I wasn't on tour, I was on my houseboat. It was my home. I had a big house I had bought for my former wife and me, but I lived mostly on the boat. That's where I had the party to end all parties, an exercise in decadence that lasted a full five years.

We partied every day and night when I was aboard. I went to the boat to get over a woman by partying away what I thought would be the last few years of my life. I didn't expect to live to be 60, not the way I had lived and not the way I was living.

It was foolish. It was like the man who consumes alcohol, a depressant because he's depressed. I thought I was going to die young because of my reckless lifestyle, so I accelerated the recklessness.

I was once off the road for 31 days, and for 31 days I never left the water. I had my toothbrush tied to the accelerator on my bass boat and let it dangle in the clear, icy waters of Lake Shasta. I'd pull it from the water when needed and jump in the lake with a bar of soap to bathe.

We put cayenne pepper and lemon in our drinking water and our skin was as clear as a model's. The life was everything Jimmy Buffett sings about. I snorted cocaine, womanized and hid from my personal pain during a binge that almost claimed my life on at least two occasions.

The party went on for years, but eventually I got tired of it. I needed something more than the party lifestyle. I needed something that would last. I needed to get back to my music, back to the thing that had given my life meaning since I was a boy.

During my party years, I think I was searching for something I couldn't name. Maybe it was peace. Maybe it was forgiveness. Maybe it was just the simple understanding that comes from being accepted for who you are, not who people want you to be.

The music industry has a way of changing people, of making them into something they're not. The pressure to be a star, to live up to everyone's expectations, can crush a person's soul if they're not careful. I'd seen it happen to too many good people, too many talented artists who lost themselves in the machinery of show business.

But during those years on the boat, I wasn't worried about being a star. I wasn't worried about hit records or award shows or what the critics thought of my music. I was just trying to survive each day, trying to find some way to make sense of the mess I'd made of my life.

Looking back now, I can see that those years weren't entirely wasted. They taught me things about myself that I might never have learned otherwise. They showed me how low a person can sink and still find a way back up. They proved to me that no matter how far you fall, there's always a chance for redemption if you're willing to work for it.

The boat years also taught me about friendship. The people who stayed with me during that time, who partied with me but also looked out for me, they were the real friends. They didn't judge me for my excesses or try to change me. They just accepted me as I was and helped me get through each day.

Freddy Powers was one of those friends. Despite the incident with the dog, despite all the crazy things we did together, he was always there when I needed him. He was a talented songwriter and a good man, and he helped me through some of the darkest periods of my life.

But even the best friendships can't save you from yourself. Eventually, you have to decide that you want something better, something more meaningful than just getting through another day. You have to decide that your life is worth saving, that the person you could become is worth the effort it takes to change.

For me, that decision came slowly. It wasn't a sudden revelation or a dramatic moment. It was more like a gradual awakening, a slow recognition that the party couldn't last forever and that I needed to find a new way to live.

The music was always there, waiting for me to come back to it. Even during the worst of the party years, I never stopped writing songs or thinking about melodies. The music was like a lifeline, a connection to the part of myself that was still worth saving.

When I finally decided to get serious about my music again, it felt like coming home. The songs I wrote during that period were different from anything I'd done before. They were more honest, more raw, more real. They came from a place of genuine experience, from someone who had been to the bottom and was trying to find his way back up.

The comeback wasn't easy. The music industry had changed while I was away, and I had to prove myself all over again. But the songs were good, and people responded to them. They could hear the authenticity in my voice, the hard-won wisdom in my lyrics.

Looking back on those years now, I can see them as a necessary part of my journey. They weren't pleasant, and I wouldn't recommend that lifestyle to anyone, but they taught me things I needed to learn. They showed me who I really was when all the pretenses were stripped away.

They also showed me the power of second chances. No matter how far you fall, no matter how many mistakes you make, there's always the possibility of starting over. It's never too late to change your life, to become the person you were meant to be.

The boat years are behind me now, but they're still part of my story. They're part of the house of memories that make up my life. Some rooms in that house are darker than others, but they're all necessary. They all contributed to making me who I am today.

And today, I'm grateful for all of it - the good times and the bad, the successes and the failures, the love and the loss. It's all part of the human experience, all part of the journey that brought me to where I am now.

The house of memories is a complex place, with rooms full of joy and rooms full of sorrow. But it's my house, built from my experiences, my choices, my life. And I wouldn't trade it for anyone else's, because it's mine, and it's real, and it's the foundation of everything I've become.

I was born April 6, 1937, in a little railroad boxcar that my dad had converted into a home. We lived in Oildale, a rough little town just north of Bakersfield, California. Oildale was where the oil field workers lived, the ones who couldn't afford to live in Bakersfield proper.

Our boxcar home was tiny, but it was ours. Dad had worked hard to make it livable, putting in windows and insulation, building furniture from scraps of wood. It wasn't much, but it was a palace compared to some of the places we'd lived before.

Dad was from Oklahoma originally, one of the thousands of "Okies" who came to California during the Dust Bowl and the Depression, looking for work and a better life. He'd left everything behind - his farm, his family, his history - to come west with nothing but hope and determination.

Mom was from Arkansas, and she was just as tough as Dad in her own way. She could stretch a dollar farther than anyone I ever knew, could make a meal out of almost nothing, could keep us fed and clothed even when there was barely enough money for rent.

They were good people, my parents. They worked hard, paid their bills, went to church on Sunday. They believed in doing right, in treating people fairly, in taking care of their family. They gave me values that stayed with me even when I strayed far from the path they'd set for me.

The boxcar was cramped, especially as I got older, but it was full of love. Dad would come home from the oil fields covered in grease and dirt, but he always had time for me. He'd teach me things - how to tie knots, how to whittle, how to read the weather. He was my first hero, my first example of what a man should be.

Mom was the heart of our little home. She kept us all together, kept us fed and clean and loved. She had a beautiful voice and would sing while she worked, old songs from Arkansas, hymns from church, lullabies that would put me to sleep on cold nights.

The Depression was still going on when I was born, and times were hard for everyone we knew. But somehow, Mom and Dad made it seem like we had everything we needed. They taught me that happiness doesn't come from having a lot of things, but from appreciating what you do have and making the best of your situation.

The neighborhood we lived in was rough, but it was also close-knit. People looked out for each other, helped when they could, shared what little they had. There was a sense of community that I've never found anywhere else, a feeling that we were all in it together.

The other kids in the neighborhood came from families just like mine - working people trying to get by, people who'd come from somewhere else looking for a better life. We played together in the dirt roads and empty lots, made our own entertainment because there wasn't money for toys or movies.

I learned early that life was hard, that you had to work for everything you got, that nothing was guaranteed. But I also learned that family was everything, that love could make even the poorest home feel rich, that there was dignity in honest work no matter how humble.

Dad worked in the oil fields, dangerous work that could kill or maim a man if he wasn't careful. He'd leave early in the morning and come home late at night, tired and dirty but proud of the work he'd done. He never complained, never acted like the work was beneath him. He provided for his family, and that was what mattered.

Mom took in washing sometimes, standing over a hot tub scrubbing other people's clothes to bring in a few extra dollars. She never complained either, never acted like the work was degrading. She did what she had to do to help keep food on the table.

Watching them work so hard for so little taught me the value of money, the importance of not wasting anything. Every penny mattered in our house, every scrap of food, every piece of clothing. Nothing was thrown away if it could possibly be used for something else.

But the most important thing they taught me was about character. They showed me that who you are matters more than what you have, that how you treat people is more important than how much money you make, that keeping your word is worth more than gold.

They were strict with me, but fair. They expected me to behave, to work hard in school, to treat others with respect. When I messed up, there were consequences. But there was also forgiveness, always forgiveness, and another chance to do better.

The boxcar was home for the first few years of my life, the place where I learned to walk and talk, where I heard my first music, where I felt my first sense of security and love. It was small and humble, but it was where my story began, where the foundation of who I would become was laid.

Years later, when I was famous and had money and big houses, I would sometimes drive by that old boxcar, still sitting there in Oildale. It reminded me of where I came from, of the people who raised me, of the values they tried to instill in me even when I wasn't ready to listen.

The boxcar years were the good years, before life got complicated, before I started making the mistakes that would take me so far from home. They were the years when I was innocent, when the world seemed simple and safe, when I believed that as long as I had Mom and Dad, everything would be all right.

But life has a way of changing things, of taking away the people you love, of testing your faith and your strength. The boxcar years couldn't last forever, and soon enough, I would learn that the world was a much harder and more complicated place than I'd ever imagined.

But those early years gave me something to hold onto, something to come back to when I lost my way. They gave me a sense of who I really was underneath all the fame and the mistakes and the pain. They gave me the memory of love, of family, of home, and that memory would sustain me through the darkest times of my life.

The boxcar is still there, and so are the memories. They're part of my house of memories now, one of the brightest rooms in a house that contains many dark corners. They remind me that no matter how far I traveled or how lost I became, I always had a home to come back to, at least in my heart.

In 1946, when I was nine years old, my world came crashing down. Dad had a stroke, and everything changed overnight. One day he was my strong, capable father who could fix anything and protect our family from whatever might threaten us. The next day he was a broken man who couldn't even speak clearly.

I remember coming home from school that day and finding him sitting in his chair, his face twisted, his left side not working right. Mom was crying, trying to take care of him, trying to figure out what to do. The doctors said he might get better, but we all knew, even as young as I was, that our lives had changed forever.

Dad never fully recovered from that stroke. He tried to go back to work, but he couldn't do the physical labor that the oil fields required. He had to take lighter jobs, jobs that paid less money, and our family struggled financially in ways we never had before.

But the money wasn't the worst part. The worst part was watching my father, my hero, struggle with the simplest tasks. He'd get frustrated when he couldn't find the words he wanted to say, angry when his body wouldn't do what his mind told it to do. The proud, strong man I'd known was disappearing before my eyes.

Mom did her best to hold our family together. She took on more work, watched over Dad, tried to keep me from seeing how scared she was. But I could see it anyway. I could see the worry in her eyes, the way she counted every penny, the way she prayed a little longer at night.

I started getting into trouble around this time. I wasn't a bad kid, but I was angry and confused and looking for someone to blame for what was happening to our family. I got into fights at school, talked back to teachers, did things I knew were wrong just because I could.

Mom tried to discipline me, but she had so much else to worry about. Dad tried too, but he wasn't the same man anymore. His authority had been undermined by his illness, and I knew it. I started to feel like I was on my own in the world, like the adults who were supposed to take care of me couldn't even take care of themselves.

The stroke changed Dad in other ways too. He became more religious, spending hours reading the Bible and praying. He'd talk about God's plan and how everything happened for a reason, but I couldn't understand why God would want to hurt a good man like my father.

Sometimes I'd catch Dad staring out the window with tears in his eyes, and I knew he was thinking about all the things he couldn't do anymore, all the dreams he'd had to give up. He'd been planning to buy us a real house someday, to give Mom and me a better life. Now he could barely support us in the boxcar.

The neighbors were kind to us during this time. They'd bring food sometimes, offer to help with Dad, include us in their prayers. But I could also sense their pity, and I hated it. I didn't want to be the family people felt sorry for. I wanted things to go back to the way they were before.

At school, I became known as a troublemaker. I'd mouth off to teachers, get into fights with other kids, skip classes when I could get away with it. The principal called Mom to the school several times, but she was too overwhelmed to know what to do with me.

I started hanging around with older kids, kids who smoked cigarettes and drank beer and did other things that would have horrified my parents if they'd known. I was looking for excitement, for danger, for anything that would make me feel alive and in control of my own destiny.

The truth was, I was scared. Scared that Dad might die, scared that Mom might not be able to take care of us, scared that we might lose our home and end up on the streets. I was too young to understand that fear is a normal part of life, that everyone faces uncertainty and loss. I just knew that the safe, secure world I'd known was gone, and I didn't know how to deal with that.

Music became my escape during this time. I'd discovered the radio, and I'd listen for hours to country music stations, learning the words to every song, dreaming of being like the singers I heard. Hank Williams was my favorite - his voice seemed to speak directly to the pain and confusion I was feeling.

I started trying to play guitar, though we couldn't afford to buy one. I'd borrow instruments from neighbors or friends, practicing whenever I could. Music was the one thing that made sense to me, the one thing that could take me away from the problems at home.

When I played or sang, I felt like myself again. I felt like I had some control over my world, like I could create something beautiful out of all the ugliness and pain around me. It was the beginning of my understanding that music could be a way to survive, a way to make sense of life when nothing else made sense.

But I was also starting to rebel in more serious ways. I was running with a rough crowd, staying out late, getting into trouble with the law. I was heading down a path that would lead me far from the values my parents had tried to teach me.

Dad's stroke was the beginning of my real troubles, the event that set me on the road to San Quentin and all the heartache that followed. It taught me that life could change in an instant, that the people you counted on could be taken away from you, that security was an illusion.

Looking back now, I can see that I was just a scared little boy who didn't know how to handle the loss of his father's strength and protection. I can forgive that boy his mistakes, understand why he made the choices he did. But at the time, all I knew was that I was angry and lost and looking for someone or something to fill the void that had opened up in my life.

The stroke changed everything for our family. It was the end of innocence, the beginning of hard times, the first crack in the foundation of my world. Nothing would ever be quite the same after that day in 1946 when I came home to find my father broken and my future uncertain.

But even in that darkness, there were lessons to be learned. I learned about Mom's strength, about her ability to keep going even when everything seemed hopeless. I learned that love doesn't disappear when times get hard, it just gets tested. And I learned that music could be a source of comfort and hope when everything else failed.

Those lessons would serve me well in the years to come, when I would face even greater challenges and darker times. The stroke was just the beginning of my education in loss and pain and survival. There would be much more to learn before I found my way back to the light.

The train whistle that woke me every morning at dawn wasn't just a sound; it was a call to adventure, a promise of escape, a siren song that would eventually lead me both to my salvation and my damnation. From our little boxcar home in Oildale, I could see the railroad tracks stretching out in both directions, disappearing into the distance like silver ribbons pointing toward possibilities I could only imagine.

I was probably ten years old when I first got the idea to hop a freight train. The older kids in the neighborhood talked about it like it was the most natural thing in the world - just wait for a slow-moving train, run alongside it, grab onto a ladder, and swing yourself up into an empty boxcar. They made it sound easy, exciting, like the ultimate adventure for a boy who felt trapped in a world that had become too small for his restless spirit.

Dad was still alive then, but he was different after the stroke. He couldn't work like he used to, couldn't be the strong protector I'd always counted on. Mom was working extra hours just to keep food on the table, and I felt like I was in the way, like another burden for her to carry when she already had more than she could handle.

The first time I actually did it, I was scared out of my mind. I waited behind some bushes near the tracks until I heard a train coming, then ran out and grabbed onto the ladder of a boxcar as it rumbled past. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst, but I managed to pull myself up and into the car.

Inside that boxcar, for the first time since Dad's stroke, I felt free. The train was carrying me away from all the problems at home, away from the worried looks on Mom's face, away from the sight of Dad struggling to do simple things that used to be second nature to him. I was moving, going somewhere, even if I didn't know where.

I rode that train for about twenty miles before jumping off in a little town whose name I never learned. Then I walked back home along the highway, getting there just as the sun was setting. Mom was frantic with worry, and when she saw me coming up the road, dirty and tired but grinning like a fool, she grabbed me and hugged me and then gave me the switching of my life.

But even the switching couldn't keep me away from those trains. The feeling of freedom I'd experienced in that boxcar was like a drug, and I was already addicted. Within a week, I was back at the tracks, waiting for another train, ready for another adventure.

Sometimes I'd ride just a few miles, sometimes much farther. I learned which trains were headed which direction, which ones stopped in towns where I could find something to eat or a safe place to sleep. I met other kids doing the same thing, and older men too - hobos and drifters who'd made the railroads their home.

These men taught me things my father never could have. They showed me how to survive on my own, how to find food when you don't have money, how to stay warm when you don't have shelter, how to avoid the railroad bulls who'd arrest you or beat you if they caught you riding illegally.

Some of these men were dangerous, and I learned to be careful around them. But others were kind, generous with their knowledge and what little they had. They'd share their food with a hungry kid, teach him the rules of the road, warn him about the places and people to avoid.

One old hobo named Charlie took me under his wing for a while. He'd lost his leg in a railroad accident years before, but he still rode the trains because it was the only life he knew. He taught me how to read the symbols other hobos left chalked on buildings and fence posts - signs that would tell you where to find food, where the law was friendly, where it was safe to sleep.

Charlie also taught me about the music of the rails. He carried an old harmonica in his pocket, and in the evenings, when we'd built a fire near the tracks, he'd play sad, beautiful melodies that seemed to capture all the loneliness and longing of life on the road. He taught me some of those songs, and I can still play them today.

But the railroad life wasn't all romance and adventure. It was dangerous, dirty, and often hungry work. I saw men who'd lost fingers or hands to coupling cars, who'd been beaten by railroad security, who'd frozen to death in empty boxcars during cold snaps. The romance wore off pretty quickly when you saw the reality of what that life could do to a person.

The problem was, I couldn't seem to stop. Even when I saw the dangers, even when I got hurt or hungry or scared, I kept going back to those trains. There was something about the movement, the rhythm of wheels on rails, the sense of possibility that came with not knowing where you'd end up, that I couldn't resist.

I was running away from something, though I couldn't have articulated what it was at the time. I was running away from the responsibility of being the man of the house when I was still just a boy. I was running away from the pain of watching my father struggle with his disability. I was running away from a future that seemed predetermined and limiting.

But I was also running toward something. I was running toward the unknown, toward adventure, toward the possibility that somewhere out there was a life that would make sense to me in ways that my current life didn't. I was looking for my place in the world, even though I was still too young to understand what that meant.

The train hopping led to other problems. I started missing more and more school, falling behind in my studies, getting into trouble with truant officers. I was picked up by the police several times and brought home to my increasingly desperate mother.

Mom tried everything she could think of to keep me home. She pleaded with me, punished me, even had the local minister talk to me about the path I was heading down. But nothing worked. The call of those train whistles was stronger than any authority figure or threat of punishment.

Dad tried to talk to me too, but his words came slowly and sometimes slurred because of the stroke, and I was impatient with him. I'm ashamed to admit it now, but I sometimes acted like I couldn't understand him just to avoid having to listen to his lectures about responsibility and staying out of trouble.

The truth was, I was angry at Dad for getting sick, angry at him for not being the strong protector he used to be, angry at him for leaving Mom and me to figure out how to survive on our own. I knew it wasn't his fault, but I was too young and too scared to know how to deal with those feelings in a healthy way.

So I kept running to the trains, kept looking for that feeling of freedom and possibility that I could only find in an empty boxcar rolling through the California countryside. Each time I left, I told myself it would be the last time. Each time I came back, I was already planning the next trip.

The train hopping was the beginning of a pattern that would define much of my youth and young adulthood - a pattern of running away from problems instead of facing them, of looking for escape instead of solutions, of choosing the excitement of the unknown over the security of home and family.

It was also the beginning of my real trouble with the law. The railroad police didn't take kindly to kids hopping freights, and I was arrested several times for trespassing on railroad property. Each arrest led to more problems at home, more worry for Mom, more disappointment from the few authority figures who still cared about what happened to me.

But those trains also gave me something valuable - they gave me an understanding of America that most kids my age never got. I saw poverty and wealth, kindness and cruelty, hope and despair. I met people from all walks of life, heard their stories, learned about their dreams and struggles.

Most importantly, the trains introduced me to a wider world of music. In hobo camps and small-town diners, I heard songs I'd never heard on the radio, met musicians who played for tips and meals instead of fame and fortune. They were keeping alive traditions of American music that went back generations, and they were generous in sharing those traditions with a young boy who was hungry to learn.

The train-hopping years were formative in ways I couldn't understand at the time. They taught me about independence and self-reliance, but they also taught me about the dangers of running away from your problems. They gave me material for songs I'd write years later, but they also set me on a path toward even more serious trouble.

Looking back now, I can see that those years on the rails were both a blessing and a curse. They opened up the world to me, but they also started me down a road that would lead to years of heartache for me and the people who loved me. They were the beginning of my education in the harder side of life, but they were also the beginning of my journey away from the values and stability my parents had tried to give me.

The sound of train whistles still moves me today. When I hear one in the distance, I'm transported back to those days when I was young and restless and convinced that the answer to all my problems lay somewhere down the tracks. I know better now, but I can still feel the pull of that lonesome whistle, still remember what it felt like to believe that freedom was just one boxcar ride away.

Those trains carried me away from my childhood and toward an uncertain future. They were my escape from a world that had become too painful to bear, but they were also my first step toward a life of running from trouble instead of facing it head-on. The lessons I learned in those empty boxcars would stay with me for years to come, for better and for worse.`;

      content: `Harper Audio presents My House of Memories by Merle Haggard with Tom Carter and read by Merle Haggard. 

I've had a blessed life, despite many lows, many of which were of my own doing. There have been times when I simply could not see the light at the end of the economic, romantic, psychological, or emotional tunnel. I've lived through 17 stays in penal institutions, incarceration in state prison, five marriages, bankruptcy, a broken back, brawls, shooting incidents, swindlings, sickness, the death of loved ones, and more.

And I've heard 10,000 chant my name when I couldn't hear the voice of my own soul. And I wondered if God was listening, and I was sure that no one else was. My unhappiness at times was so overwhelming, if anyone had ever told me that I'd be as content as I am today, I would have thought they were talking about someone else.

So I decided to share what has worked for me, knowing it'll work for others. I'm a little embarrassed about some of the stories I'm gonna tell. They're more like confessions than mere reporting of events. And I really can't tell you how high I've been unless I tell you how low I sunk.

Today at times I have peace of mind, the love of God, a good woman, and a family. Today I'm on track, or at least that's what they tell me. Welcome to my world. Enter through the gate of my house of memories.

This autobiography is my attempt to make sense of a life that has been filled with both tremendous highs and devastating lows. It's the story of a man who has been to the bottom and back again, who has made more mistakes than any one person should be allowed to make, and who has somehow found redemption in the most unlikely places.

I'm not proud of everything I've done. In fact, I'm ashamed of many of my actions over the years. But I've learned that shame and regret, while they can eat you alive if you let them, can also be powerful teachers if you're willing to listen to what they have to say.

My story begins in a converted railroad boxcar in Oildale, California, and winds through honky-tonk bars, prison cells, recording studios, and concert halls across America. It's a story of music and mayhem, of love lost and found, of dreams deferred and ultimately realized.

But most of all, it's a story about the power of second chances. No matter how far you fall, no matter how many people you disappoint, no matter how lost you become, there's always the possibility of redemption. It may not come easy, and it may not come quickly, but it can come if you're willing to do the work.

I've been blessed to have music as my salvation. When everything else in my life was falling apart, when I couldn't trust myself or anyone else, I could always trust the music. It was my constant companion through the darkest times, my voice when I couldn't find the words to speak, my hope when everything else seemed hopeless.

This book is my way of giving back, of sharing what I've learned in the hope that it might help someone else who is struggling. If my story can prevent just one person from making the same mistakes I made, if it can give just one person the hope they need to keep going, then it will have been worth telling.

So welcome to my world. It's not always a pretty place, but it's real, and it's honest, and it's mine. These are my memories, my confessions, my attempts to understand the man I was and the man I've become. Come in, sit down, and let me tell you a story about the long, winding road from a boxcar to the stage, and all the stops along the way.`,

      title: "The Houseboat Years",
      content: `People milled nervously, fidgeting and looking at their feet the way folks do when embarrassed or angry. They gawked at what they probably thought was a madman in swimming trunks on a mammoth boat in front of them. He was yelling profanities that echoed across northern California's sprawling Lake Shasta for hundreds of yards, as sound does on water.

"Shut up, Grandma. I'm busy," he hollered. "Shut up. I'll be there in a minute. Damn it, shut up." The onlookers stared in disbelief. Perhaps the man was drunk. Perhaps he was high. No matter. No one had the right, the crowd obviously thought, to talk to his grandmother that way.

That was Freddy Powers, my long-time songwriting partner who shared a houseboat next to mine. He really was yelling at a little dog that had been abandoned by its owner. We paid substantially to have its teeth pulled and bones repaired. The veterinarian said without dental work, the dog would have died from infection.

In those days, if I wasn't on tour, I was on my houseboat. It was my home. That's where I had the party to end all parties, an exercise in decadence that lasted a full five years. We partied every day and night when I was aboard. I went to the boat to get over a woman by partying away what I thought would be the last few years of my life.

I didn't expect to live to be 60, not the way I had lived and not the way I was living. It was foolish. It was like the man who consumes alcohol, a depressant because he's depressed. I thought I was going to die young because of my reckless lifestyle, so I accelerated the recklessness.

I was once off the road for 31 days, and for 31 days I never left the water. I had my toothbrush tied to the accelerator on my bass boat and let it dangle in the clear, icy waters of Lake Shasta. I'd pull it from the water when needed and jump in the lake with a bar of soap to bathe.

We put cayenne pepper and lemon in our drinking water and our skin was as clear as a model's. The life was everything Jimmy Buffett sings about. I snorted cocaine, womanized and hid from my personal pain during a binge that almost claimed my life on at least two occasions.

Those were dark years, years when I was running from everything that mattered to me. I'd achieved everything I thought I wanted - number one records, awards, fame, money - but none of it seemed to fill the hole inside me. So I tried to fill it with parties and substances and meaningless encounters, thinking that if I could just party hard enough, long enough, the pain would go away.

But pain has a way of following you wherever you go. You can't outrun it, you can't drink it away, you can't snort it away. It's always there, waiting for you when the party ends, when the sun comes up, when you're alone with your thoughts and your regrets.

The houseboat became my refuge from the world, but it also became my prison. I was trapped there by my own excess, my own inability to face the real problems in my life. The parties were a distraction, the drugs were an escape, but they weren't solutions. They were just ways of postponing the inevitable reckoning with myself.

Looking back now, I can see that those years on the water were necessary in some strange way. They were rock bottom for me, the place I had to reach before I could start climbing back up. They showed me just how far I could fall, how much damage I could do to myself and the people around me.

But they also showed me that I was tougher than I thought, that I could survive almost anything. They taught me about the darkness that lives inside all of us, and they prepared me for the long journey back to the light.

The houseboat years were a chapter in my life that I'm not proud of, but they were also a chapter that taught me valuable lessons about myself and about what really matters in life. They were part of my education in what it means to be human, complete with all the mistakes and failures and poor choices that come with that territory.

Eventually, I got tired of the party. I got tired of waking up feeling empty and lost, tired of disappointing the people who cared about me, tired of wasting the gifts I'd been given. The boat had served its purpose as a place to hide and to hurt, but I was ready to start living again instead of just surviving.

The houseboat years ended not with a dramatic moment or a sudden revelation, but with a gradual recognition that I deserved better, that the people who loved me deserved better, and that the music I'd been given to share with the world deserved better than what I was giving it.

It was time to come back to shore, time to face the music, time to start the long journey back to myself.`,

      title: "The Boxcar Years",
      content: `I was born April 6, 1937 at Kern General Hospital in Bakersfield, California. And I was reared inside a former railroad boxcar. My dad, James Haggard, had heard about a boxcar that he thought could be converted into a home. And he did, despite discouraging remarks from its owner about his plans.

Dad had moved to Oildale, a suburb of Bakersfield, from Oklahoma earlier that year. His barn had burned by lightning or arson to the ground, and he left because of that. He did not yield to the Depression or the elements, like some of the others did. He simply lost everything he owned and had nowhere else to go except California.

The boxcar he converted into a house was the first home I ever ran away from as a boy. It sat in a row of houses and still stands today, 62 years later. I guess one of my earliest memories of life in the boxcar has to do with my dad taking me to buy a puppy when I was three.

Dad bought the puppy from Harold Granger. Funny, whose names we remember and whose we don't. I can't remember the names of some of the worthless record company executives or parole officers I've dealt with, but I can remember the man that supplied my first Fox Terrier.

My childhood in Oildale was the most peaceful time of my life. I hadn't yet developed the restlessness that haunted me in my teenage years. I was content to play with my dog and go fishing with my dad. He used to drive home from church with two wheels on the railroad just to make me laugh.

I loved the fact that he'd do most anything to make me laugh. About the only things I disliked as a child were church and school. Church meant dressing up and sitting too long in one place, while some man hollered and folks listened. The preacher always had more style than substance. To a kid, it was boring, to say the least.

I was never a good student because my mind was always somewhere outside the classroom. I didn't want to study history. I wanted to make it, although I didn't realize it at the time. The remainder of my childhood world was running with a few pals and fishing the Kern River with Dad. He was my best friend.

In the 1940s, divorce wasn't commonplace the way it is today. People lived simple lives with their families. Daddies read newspapers and mamas read the Bible. Boys grew up and men grew old back then. That was the natural order of things, which I took for granted as much as the next sunrise.

Parents didn't leave and they didn't die, or so I thought. The boxcar was small, but it was filled with love. Dad would come home from work at the railroad, tired and dirty, but he always had time for me. He'd teach me things - how to fish, how to whittle, how to be a man.

Mom was the heart of our little home. She could make a meal out of almost nothing, could stretch a dollar further than anyone I knew. She had a beautiful voice and would sing while she worked, old songs that seemed to carry all the hopes and dreams of our family.

Those were simple times, but they were good times. We didn't have much money, but we had each other, and that seemed like enough. The Depression was hard on everyone, but somehow Dad and Mom made it seem like we were the luckiest family in the world.

I learned values in that boxcar that would stay with me for the rest of my life, even when I strayed far from them. I learned about hard work and honesty, about treating people fairly and keeping your word. I learned about the importance of family and the power of love to overcome any obstacle.

But I also learned about the pain of losing what you love. The boxcar years couldn't last forever, and when they ended, they ended in a way that would change me forever. The innocence and security of those early years would be shattered by events beyond my control, and I would spend much of the rest of my life trying to find my way back to that sense of peace and belonging.

The boxcar still stands in Oildale, a reminder of where I came from and what I lost along the way. Sometimes when I drive by it, I can almost see that little boy playing in the yard, hear Dad's laughter, smell Mom's cooking. Those memories are precious to me now, more precious than any award or accolade I've ever received.

The boxcar years were the foundation of everything that came after. They were the source of the values that would eventually save me, the memories that would sustain me through the darkest times, the love that would call me home when I was lost and wandering in the wilderness of my own making.

They were the beginning of my story, the first chapter in a life that would be filled with many chapters, some dark and some light, but all of them leading back to the simple truths I learned in that converted railroad car in Oildale, California.`,
