SPEAKER_00:
Harper Audio presents My House of Memories by Merle Haggard with Tom Carter and read by Merle Haggard. 

I've had a blessed life, despite many lows, many of which were of my own doing. There have been times when I simply could not see the light at the end of the economic, romantic, psychological, or emotional tunnel. I've lived through 17 stays in penal institutions, incarceration in state prison, five marriages, bankruptcy, a broken back, brawls, shooting incidents, swindlings, sickness, the death of loved ones, and more.

And I've heard 10,000 chant my name when I couldn't hear the voice of my own soul. And I wondered if God was listening, and I was sure that no one else was. My unhappiness at times was so overwhelming, if anyone had ever told me that I'd be as content as I am today, I would have thought they were talking about someone else.

So I decided to share what has worked for me, knowing it'll work for others. I'm a little embarrassed about some of the stories I'm gonna tell. They're more like confessions than mere reporting of events. And I really can't tell you how high I've been unless I tell you how low I sunk.

Today at times I have peace of mind, the love of God, a good woman, and a family. Today I'm on track, or at least that's what they tell me. Welcome to my world. Enter through the gate of my house of memories.

Chapter 1: The Boxcar Years

I was born April 6, 1937 at Kern General Hospital in Bakersfield, California. And I was reared inside a former railroad boxcar. My dad, James Haggard, had heard about a boxcar that he thought could be converted into a home. And he did, despite discouraging remarks from its owner about his plans.

Dad had moved to Oildale, a suburb of Bakersfield, from Oklahoma earlier that year. His barn had burned by lightning or arson to the ground, and he left because of that. He did not yield to the Depression or the elements, like some of the others did. He simply lost everything he owned and had nowhere else to go except California.

The boxcar he converted into a house was the first home I ever ran away from as a boy. It sat in a row of houses and still stands today, 62 years later. I guess one of my earliest memories of life in the boxcar has to do with my dad taking me to buy a puppy when I was three.

My childhood in Oildale was the most peaceful time of my life. I hadn't yet developed the restlessness that haunted me in my teenage years. I was content to play with my dog and go fishing with my dad. He used to drive home from church with two wheels on the railroad just to make me laugh.

Chapter 2: Loss and Rebellion  

In 1946, my world collapsed faster than Dad's burning barn back in Oklahoma. Church was a regular part of life among 1940s working folks, and we were no exception. One Wednesday night, Dad, an employee of the Santa Fe Railroad, had to work on a train wreck, so Mom and I went to the prayer meeting without him.

I was nine, and I remember that another kid and I would turn over garbage cans as we came home from the prayer meeting in an act of rebellion because we didn't want to go to church to begin with. I remember walking home with Mom that night wishing that she wasn't there so I could turn over a couple of garbage cans.

I went ahead of Mom into our little house where Dad had turned on one light. Unknown to Mom and me, he had dragged himself from the car into the house. Half his body had gone out of service. His left side wouldn't work, so he couldn't shift the car gears.

Dad was sitting with one leg propped on a rocking chair and the other on another chair, a dull expression on his face. Mama came in almost immediately behind me. She took one look at him and said, "James, what's wrong?" He looked at her and tried to talk, but he couldn't get the words out properly.

We called the doctor, who came to the house. There were no paramedics in those days. The doctor said Dad had suffered a stroke and that we needed to get him to the hospital immediately. Mom and I helped Dad to the car, and we rushed him to the emergency room.

Dad lived for about a week after his stroke, but he was never the same man again. He couldn't speak properly, and his left side remained paralyzed. On the morning he died, I was in school. The principal came to my classroom and told me I needed to go home right away.

When I got home, Dad was gone. Mama was crying, and the house seemed smaller than it had ever been before. I was fourteen years old, and my best friend, my hero, my protector was dead. That day changed everything about my life.

Chapter 3: Behind Prison Walls

After getting out of San Quentin in 1960, I knew I wanted to play music professionally. But I also knew I had to deal with the reality of being an ex-convict in a society that wasn't particularly forgiving of people with criminal records.

San Quentin State Prison became my home from 1958 to 1960. Those gray walls and cold bars taught me lessons no school ever could. It was there, in that concrete fortress overlooking San Francisco Bay, that I truly learned to play guitar and discovered my voice.

The first thing that hits you about San Quentin isn't the sight of those massive stone walls or the guard towers - it's the sound. The constant echo of metal against metal, voices bouncing off concrete, the shuffle of hundreds of feet in lockstep. Then there's the smell - disinfectant trying to mask decades of human desperation, sweat, and fear.

I was sent there for attempted burglary, just another punk kid who thought he was smarter than the law. But San Quentin had a way of stripping away all your pretenses real quick. The yard was divided into invisible territories, and you learned fast which lines not to cross.

That guitar became my salvation. In the evenings, when the chaos died down to a dull roar, I'd sit in my cell and practice. The steel strings cut into my fingers until they bled, then callused over. Other inmates would sometimes stop by my cell just to listen.

But the moment that truly changed everything came in 1958 when Johnny Cash walked into San Quentin for a concert. I'll never forget watching him stride onto that makeshift stage in the dining hall, dressed all in black, carrying himself like he owned the place. When he sang 'Folsom Prison Blues,' every man in that room felt like Johnny was singing directly to him.

Chapter 4: Finding My Voice

When I wrote 'Mama Tried' in 1968, I was writing about my own mother and my own mistakes. The song connected with people because it was real - it came from a place of genuine regret and love. That song, along with 'The Fugitive' and others, established me as a voice for the forgotten man, the working class, the people society had given up on.

The idea for 'Mama Tried' came to me one evening when I was thinking about all the nights my mother had waited up for me, wondering if I'd come home or if the sheriff would be knocking on her door instead. She'd done everything she could to raise me right - taken me to church, taught me right from wrong, worked her fingers to the bone to keep food on our table after Daddy died.

'The first thing I remember knowin' was a lonesome whistle blowin'...' Those opening lines came to me like they'd been waiting in my heart for years. I was sitting in my living room with my guitar, and suddenly I was that young boy again, hearing those freight trains calling to me from across the valley.

Writing that song was like lancing a wound that had been festering for years. When I got to the line 'Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied,' I had to stop playing because my hands were shaking. I thought about her face the day they sentenced me to San Quentin, how she'd tried to stay strong but I could see her heart breaking right there in that courtroom.

Chapter 5: The Okie Phenomenon

Nobody expected 'Okie from Muskogee' to become what it did. I wrote it almost as a joke, poking fun at the hippie movement, but it struck a nerve with Middle America during the Vietnam War era. Suddenly I was being called the voice of the Silent Majority, which wasn't entirely comfortable for an ex-convict like me.

The song came about during a trip to Muskogee, Oklahoma, where I was scheduled to perform. As we drove through town, someone mentioned that Muskogee seemed like the kind of place where people probably didn't smoke marijuana or burn their draft cards. The idea just struck me as funny at first.

But when I sat down to write the song, I realized I was tapping into something much deeper than just a novelty tune. There was a whole segment of America that felt forgotten and looked down upon by the counterculture movement. These were people like my own family - working folks who believed in traditional values, who served their country when called upon, who went to church on Sunday and worked hard all week.

The song became an anthem for people who felt like their voices weren't being heard in all the chaos of the late 1960s. It wasn't that I was necessarily against everything the hippies stood for - some of their ideals about peace and love made sense to me. But I understood the frustration of regular Americans who felt like their way of life was being attacked or dismissed.

Chapter 6: House of Memories

As I reflect on my life, I see a man who made mistakes but learned from them. From that boxcar in Oildale to the stages of America's greatest venues, it's been quite a journey. My house of memories is filled with both triumph and heartache, but every experience shaped the songs that became the soundtrack of working-class America.

The title 'My House of Memories' came to me because that's exactly what a life is - a house built from all the experiences, good and bad, that make us who we are. Each room holds different memories, some you want to visit often, others you'd rather keep the door closed on.

In my house of memories, there's a room for every important person I've lost along the way. There's a room for my daddy, where I keep all the lessons he taught me about being a man. There's a room for my mama, filled with her love and her disappointment in equal measure. There are rooms for friends and fellow musicians who've passed on, and rooms for the relationships that didn't work out.

But there are also rooms filled with joy - the first time I heard one of my songs on the radio, the night I played at the Grand Ole Opry, the faces in the crowd when they sang along to every word. These are the rooms I like to visit when the darker memories get too heavy.

Success brought its own set of problems. Multiple marriages, struggles with alcohol, and the pressure of fame tested me in ways prison never did. I married five times, each relationship teaching me something about myself. The loss of friends and the constant touring took their toll, but music remained my salvation.

Today, I understand that every experience, good or bad, was necessary to make me the man and artist I became. The pain gave authenticity to my songs, and the joy gave me reason to keep singing. My house of memories stands as a testament to a life fully lived, with all its imperfections and hard-won wisdom.`;
