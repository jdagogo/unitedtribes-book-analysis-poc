  "fullText": "Harper Audio presents My House of Memories by Merle Haggard with Tom Carter and read by Merle Haggard. I've had a blessed life, despite many lows, many of which were of my own doing. There have been times when I simply could not see the light at the end of the economic, romantic, psychological, or emotional tunnel. I've lived through 17 stays in penal institutions, incarceration in state prison, five marriages, bankruptcy, a broken back, brawls, shooting incidents, swindlings, sickness, the death of loved ones, and more. And I've heard 10,000 chant my name when I couldn't hear the voice of my own soul. And I wondered if God was listening, and I was sure that no one else was. My unhappiness at times was so overwhelming, if anyone had ever told me that I'd be as content as I am today, I would have thought they were talking about someone else. So I decided to share what has worked for me, knowing it'll work for others. I'm a little embarrassed about some of the stories I'm gonna tell. They're more like confessions than mere reporting of events. And I really can't tell you how high I've been unless I tell you how low I sunk. Today at times I have peace of mind, the love of God, a good woman, and a family. Today I'm on track, or at least that's what they tell me. Welcome to my world. Enter through the gate of my house of memories. People milled nervously, fidgeting and looking at their feet the way folks do when embarrassed or angry. They gawked at what they probably thought was a madman in swimming trunks on a mammoth boat in front of them. He was yelling profanities that echoed across northern California's sprawling Lake Shasta for hundreds of yards, as sound does on water. Shut up, Grandma. I'm busy, he hollered. Shut up. I'll be there in a minute. Damn it, shut up. The onlooker stared in disbelief. Perhaps the man was drunk. Perhaps he was high. No matter. No one had the right, the crowd obviously thought, to talk to his grandmother that way. The man on the boat stepped way over line. Screw you, Grandma, he yelled. Suddenly, he noticed the crowd gathering before the boat, tied up at Silverthorne Resort Marina near Jones Valley, and he smiled sheepishly. No one smiled back. Oh, no, he said with disgust. You think I'm talking to my grandmother. The expressionless people continued their silent vigil. Decent people hate people who abuse their elders almost as much as they hate those who abuse children. It's not what you think, the man on the boat tried to explain. Wait till I show you. He dropped below the deck, sounded like a man yelling from inside a cave. The owner could still hear him snapping at Grandma. Eventually, he emerged from the boat with a teacup poodle. This, he said, holding up the canine, is Grandma. The people looked at each other and then back at him. This really is Grandma, he insisted. No one spoke. It was clear they thought he was the vilest man on earth. or at least on Lake Shasta. The hostile group didn't appear to buy the yarn that he had a dog named Grandma. Still the man stood there holding the hapless dog in the air, its limp tongue hanging out of its toothless mouth. The sight of the pitiful pooch did not bolster the man's credibility. Everyone in the crowd would later tell friends about the creep at the marina. They had seen Freddy Powers, my long-time salt-writing partner who shared a houseboat next to mine, from about 1982 until about, oh, it must have been 1988. He really was yelling at a little dog that had been abandoned by its owner and had wandered its way into our party. And we paid substantially to have its teeth pulled and bones repaired. The veterinarian said without dental work, the dog would have died from infection. Freddy saved the dog's life by subsidizing its medical care, but his kindness toward the pooch had backfired on him that day at Silverthorne Resort. In those days, if I wasn't on tour, I was on my houseboat. It was my home. I had a big house I had bought for my former wife and me, but I lived mostly on the boat. That's where I had the party to end all parties, an exercise in decadence that lasted a full five years. We partied every day and night when I was aboard. I went to the boat to get over a woman by partying away what I thought would be the last few years of my life. I didn't expect to live to be 60, not the way I had lived and not the way I was living. It was foolish. It was like the man who consumes alcohol, a depressant because he's depressed. I thought I was going to die young because of my reckless lifestyle, so I accelerated the recklessness. I was once off the road for 31 days, and for 31 days I never left the water. I had my toothbrush tied to the accelerator on my bass boat and let it dangle in the clear, icy waters of Lake Shasta. I'd pull it from the water when needed and jump in the lake with a bar of soap to bathe. We put cayenne pepper and lemon in our drinking water and our skin was as clear as a model's. The life was everything Jimmy Buffett sings about. Snorted cocaine womanized and hid from my personal pain during a binge that almost claimed my life on at least two occasions. Freddie's boat was parked next to mine. In fact, five men shared four boats at our T-shaped dock. A woman wasn't safe, and her reputation was quickly shot if she came down there. But plenty of them did. Freddie bought an ultralight pontoon aircraft, which he had no idea how to fly at the time. and I had a pilot's license and taught him what I knew from the ground. I couldn't join him on his maiden flight because his plane held only one person. He eventually used it to fly around the lake to locate women who were sunbathing in the nude. There's plenty of that in the wooded coves on Lake Shasta, for that matter, throughout California. Freddie would call me while he was in flight to announce the location of the Sunbathers, or he'd wait until he flew back to the boat to tell me. He'd land his aquaplane on the water in front of the dock. Then we'd take my boat to where the women were. We met a lot of willing females that way. Since I was living there anyhow, and since I thought I saw potential in the Silverthorne Resort, I bought ownership in the place. I turned it into a $14 million losing business venture for myself, mostly due to my inexperience. It was the second worst financial mistake of my life. In 1976, I sold 25 Wendy Burger franchises for a mere $265,000 because someone told me that the burger chains were going broke and that Wendy's would never make it. Can you imagine? I could have kept 25 of those cash cows in Southern California, the fast food capital of the world. I hate to think about it, much less talk about it. Can you imagine what those things would have been worth today? I'd break your calculator. At Silverthorne, I opened a nightclub and a restaurant, and I beefed up the marina, rented cabins and 32 houseboats to tourists, and had concerts for them, too. Some of the biggest names in country music came to perform. The celebrities often stayed on the boat near mine as my guests. I had visitors from all over the country, but lost money nevertheless, due to the unfair business practices of the people I was in business with. Unfair or not, I had little to say. I had foolishly bought only 49% interest in the resort. Since my partner kept 51%, he had final say on everything. Not long after we started our association, he beat me out of $400,000. He needed that much money to build the kind of bar I had envisioned. I designed an incredible nightclub and listening room. My partner went to the bank and borrowed money, the $400,000 that we needed to build the joint. He also took the $400,000 that I offered him without saying that he'd borrowed the other money in my name. When bills were due, that was one of them. I was liable for a debt that wasn't even mine. People have asked, who was managing your affairs at the time? The answer is no one. I had fired my business manager and blew the Silverthorne project all by myself. There's no one else to blame. By 1990, seven years later, I was still paying off debts that I had incurred while owning the place. My cash flow was down, my overhead was increasing, the indebtedness overtook me. Eventually, I filed for bankruptcy. According to terms of the bankruptcy settlement, I've been paying a certain percentage on the dollar for every debt I owe in connection with Silverthorne Resort. Under those arrangements, I have paid all creditors in full. I simply didn't take care of business because I wanted the business to take care of itself while I rocked on with my reckless lifestyle. I simply let my late partner handle the business, and I handled the lifestyle that went along with owning a nightclub and resort. We had a wet t-shirt contest on the dock every Wednesday night after Silverthorne's weekly water skiing show. The late Lewis Talley, who produced my first records, was known as the hoser, because he would hose down the contestants. The contest was rigged. We gave the cash prize to the winner, and secretly, Freddie and I told the judges to select the sexiest girl to win second prize. Her prize was to ride on our boat up Pitt River with Freddie and me. It's amazing how beautiful and intelligent women will compromise themselves just to be with a well-known entertainer. A famous female singer and I once spent five days nude on the boat. We snorted cocaine the entire time and didn't go to bed once. I guess I was burned out on the entertainment industry. I'd won every major award it offered and was headlining shows in front of tens of thousands of people. By 1980, I had recorded 25 number one records, seven that had reached number two in Billboard's magazine surveys, I had been nominated for nine Grammys and had won one Grammy, and had been named Entertainer of the Year by the Country Music Association, the highest honor the CMA bestows. And I'd been to the White House on several occasions. But it wasn't as glamorous as it sounds. During the 15 years it had all happened, I'd been riding a crowded tour bus back and forth across America several times each year. An exercise in miles and monotony. I knew every interstate highway and major truck stop from sea to sea. I was getting wary of the grind. Feeding my building burnout was the fact that I had done all the network television and motion pictures I wanted. I even had a role in a Clint Eastwood film and a song in his soundtrack. The number one songs would total 41 by 1989. The highest number ever recorded by a living country music soloist, I'm told. 63 of my tunes reached the top three. More than 100 songs made Billboard's top 100. I'm not bragging, just trying to make a point. I'd done it all, I felt. So burnout and the boat hideaway went hand in hand. My then wife saw that our relationship was impossible. The more I lived with this hurtful and stormy relationship, the more hurtful and stormy it became. I intentionally haven't mentioned her name. I gave her a chance to tell her side of the story on this audio program, and she declined. Well, fine. I don't want to mention her name. And don't. But I want to thank her for leaving me. Seriously. It was one of the best things that ever happened to me. I was born April 6, 1937 at Kern General Hospital in Bakersfield, California. And I was reared inside a former railroad boxcar. My dad, James Haggard, had heard about a boxcar that he thought could be converted into a home. And he did, despite discouraging remarks from its owner about his plans. Dad had moved to Oildale, a suburb of Bakersfield, from Oklahoma earlier that year. His barn had burned by lightning or arson to the ground, and he left because of that. He did not yield to the Depression or the elements, like some of the others did. He simply lost everything he owned and had nowhere else to go except California. The boxcar he converted into a house was the first home I ever ran away from as a boy. It sat in a row of houses and still stands today, 62 years later. I guess one of my earliest memories of life in the boxcar has to do with my dad taking me to buy a puppy when I was three. Dad bought the puppy from Harold Granger. Funny, whose names we remember and whose we don't. I can't remember the names of some of the worthless record company executives or parole officers I've dealt with, but I can remember the man that supplied my first Fox Terrier. I've had a dog ever since, except when I was in prison. My first greatest hits album, released around 1970, has me on the cover with my late dog Tuffy, who traveled the country with me on my tour bus. Today I've got dogs, farm animals, and even a wolf at my place near Reading, about 150 miles south of the Oregon border. People walk onto my property and say, is that a German shepherd? It's so big, it looks like a wolf. Well, it is a wolf, I tell them. My wife, Teresa, always wanted a wolf, and we got ours when it was just a cub. A veterinarian said the animal would mistake her for its mother if she slept with it. So there we were, the three of us, in bed, my wife, my wolf, and me. Let it inhale your exhale, Teresa was advised. She breathed into the nostrils of that thing one night, and today the wolf is as gentle as any old hound. Because I was 14 years younger than my brother and 16 years younger than my sister, I developed a love for animals. My place today looks like a game reserve. I allow no hunting, and I even have a wild turkey that thinks it's a chicken. It runs with the laying hens. Each lays her eggs in about the same place daily, and Teresa gathers them up. My childhood in Oildale was the most peaceful time of my life. I hadn't yet developed the restlessness that haunted me in my teenage years. I was content to play with my dog and go fishing with my dad. He used to drive home from church with two wheels on the railroad just to make me laugh. I loved the fact that he'd do most anything to make me laugh. About the only things I disliked as a child were church and school. Church meant dressing up and sitting too long in one place, while some man hollered and folks listened. The preacher always had more style than substance. To a kid, it was boring, to say the least. I was never a good student because my mind was always somewhere outside the classroom. I didn't want to study history. I wanted to make it, although I didn't realize it at the time. The remainder of my childhood world was running with a few pals and fishing the Kern River with Dad. He was my best friend. In the 1940s, divorce wasn't commonplace the way it is today. People lived simple lives with their families. Daddies read newspapers and mamas read the Bible. Boys grew up and men grew old back then. That was the natural order of things, which I took for granted as much as the next sunrise. Parents didn't leave and they didn't die, or so I thought. In 1946, my world collapsed faster than Dad's burning barn back in Oklahoma. Church was a regular part of life among 1940s working folks, and we were no exception. One Wednesday night, Dad, an employee of the Santa Fe Railroad, had to work on a train wreck, so Mom and I went to the prayer meeting without him. I was nine, and I remember that another kid and I would turn over garbage cans as we came home from the prayer meeting in an act of rebellion because we didn't want to go to church to begin with. I remember walking home with Mom that night wishing that she wasn't there so I could turn over a couple of garbage cans. I went ahead of Mom into our little house where Dad had turned on one light. Unknown to Mom and me, he had dragged himself from the car into the house. Half his body had gone out of service. His left side wouldn't work, so he couldn't shift the car gears. Dad was sitting with one leg propped on a rocking chair and the other on another chair, a dull expression on his face. Mama came in almost immediately after me, and I was still staring in shock at Dad. Mama, I've had a stroke, he said, as my mother followed me into the room. Then he hung his head and began to weep. Dad explained how he'd stopped his car at the stop sign and signaled to make a left turn. He put his arm out the window and it fell to the side. Unable to change gears, he slowly chugged home into the yard, then began his crawl up to the house, half his body out of commission. When Dad left the hospital that coming Saturday, he seemed fine, feeling it return to his arms and legs. but the doctors wanted to take him to the Santa Fe Hospital in Los Angeles for some tests. Doctors always want to run those tests. My brother Lowell and his wife, Fran, Mom, Dad, and I went to the Santa Fe Hospital, where Dad was scheduled to be admitted at 1 p.m. We arrived early and had a picnic near the hospital. I had a headache, as I often did as a child. Merle's got a headache, Mom said to Dad. Why don't we leave him here on the blanket while I take you around to check you in? Merle's going with us, Dad said firmly. He held his eyes on her, and that scared me. Mom was usually the boss, and Dad, the backbone of the family, usually let her have her way. I never once saw him raise his hand to anybody. His stern words that day were out of character. From inside the hospital, a nurse brought a wheelchair. Do you really want me to use that, Dad asked? Might as well take advantage of it, she said. He was about to humor the nurse by easing into the chair. Instead, he fell into it. He'd suffered a massive hemorrhage. He later had a second. It was Saturday afternoon. By Tuesday, he would be dead. I'd been staying with my Aunt Flora. I heard someone knock on the door at about three o'clock in the morning. Then the sound of low voices, followed by Flora crying. I was already out of the bed when Lowell came into the room. He grabbed me and held me and said, we ain't got no daddy anymore. Life was never the same. I first ran away from home at the age of 11, a couple of years after my dad's death. Mom tried everything to tap my interest, which certainly wasn't in academics. She signed me up for violin lessons, but every time the teacher would turn her back, I entertained the class with San Antonio Rose and You Are My Sunshine. I'd already heard Bob Wills and the other western swing bands of that day. The teacher told my mom the violin lessons were a waste of money. Mama went to work after Dad passed. My sister thinks I blame myself for the fact that Mom had to work to support me. My sister Lillian and my brother Lowell were old enough to get jobs on their own. And I'm not saying I agree with Lillian's thinking. I'm simply conveying it. My sister even thinks my guilt was so intense that it spawned my need to run away. And boy, did I run away. I should have removed our door and erected a swinging gate to accommodate my departure and then my returns after capture. When Lowell told me that night that we ain't got no daddy, well, I disagreed. And I still do. I got a dad. He's somewhere, and I'm going to see him someday. Today, when friends and relatives are in trouble, people give money or goods. In the 1940s, they gave themselves. After Dad died, my mother had the wisdom to know I needed a positive role model in my life other than Lowell, who was 14 years older. So she arranged for me to spend the summer with my great-aunt Willie and my great-uncle Esker in Houston, California, near Modesto. They lived inside one room and used the wood stove for heating and cooking. And the old stoves were funny. If you were wet and cold, you had to stand right next to them to get warm because they didn't propel heat very far. If you wore denim and stood inches from the stove, its heat would dry your pants. Trouble is, it would also make them hot. So when you took a step and the back of your trousers touched your skin, it would burn like fire. To walk away from the stove in denim pants, you had to walk without bending your knees to keep from scalding your skin. So we stood by the stove, then walked around the house stiff-legged until our pants cooled. Uncle Esker let me call him Esker. It's a rite of passage when a boy is allowed to call his elders by their first name. I learned to hop a freight train about the time most boys learned to ride a two-wheel bicycle. Today, smart parents wouldn't even let 10-year-olds operate a power lawnmower. I was prepared to ride a freight train with hobos and ex-convicts, murderers, and burglars when I was at that age. Truant officers eventually came to know me by my first name. They always took me to the principal, who usually sent me home. And I was fine with that, but it never made sense to me. They sent me home from school because I refused to go to school. So I conspired with my buddy Billy Thorpe, who had lived down the street back in Oildale. There had to be life outside Houston and Oildale, and we were going to see it all. We weren't old enough to drive and didn't know how anyhow. Nobody in my circle flew in those days. We couldn't have afforded a plane ticket. A bus ticket was also too much. Besides, how would two boys get past the ticket master? I decided we'd take a freight train. Take it where, Billy asked? Anywhere it goes. During the next 18 hours, we planned what we thought would be the journey that would last the rest of our lives. We agreed to meet after school, the last day that we thought we'd ever attend, carrying all the worldly goods we'd need inside pillowcases. The train slowed down for an area just outside Aldale, and I climbed up into a hopper car, and we found a place to ride next to the wheels. The train was moving slowly. Obviously, we wouldn't have been able to board. Soon it picked up speed, and we were headed toward what we had planned to be Modesto, where we could pick peaches and make a living forever. It was after midnight when the train pulled into Fresno. We were stiff from hanging on and from the cold that goes with open exposure at 50 miles per hour. I could feel and hear the gravel of the train yard crunching beneath my shoes. I wasn't entirely sure where I was, and of course, thought I might be in Modesto. But the railroad detective knew exactly where I was. He took us straight to a detention hall. What made him think that two boys less than five feet tall carrying pillowcases were runaways? Then the railroad detected that the most humiliating thing I could have had done to me. He called my mother. She showed up at the detention center worried and relieved. And she was confused. She couldn't understand why I'd hopped a train when I had a pass. Since my dad had worked for the railroad, the pass was good until I was 18. I tried to explain that anybody could ride with a pass. It took a man to ride the way I had. Using a ticket was only movement minus adventure. She didn't get it. It wasn't the first time she didn't understand me, and it wouldn't be the last. I went to high school in Bakersfield because there wasn't one in Orlando. While there, I became friends with Mildred Carr, now Mildred Copeland. Because she smoked cigarettes, so did I. So did her friend Carol Sloss. Standing on the corner across from school, the three of us used to smoke and be cool, you know. One day, we took our coolness as a stepfather. We went across the street for a smoke and didn't return. We went downtown, two girls and me, each of us 14, just walking and talking and smoking. It was all innocent until we decided to run away. Mildred would later recall that we had five dollars among the three of us. I decided that was enough for us to hop a train. I had an immediate problem. The girls were wearing skirts, since the Bakersfield public schools didn't allow females to wear slacks in those days. How were the girls going to hop a train in skirts? I decided I'd take them to my house in Oildale on Yosemite Street and give them a pair of my pants. After spending 15 cents on bus fare, we had $4.85 remaining on our trip to Las Vegas. We had also determined that I was going to gamble and make a ton of money. And then we might use some of the proceeds to ride a passenger train home, if we came home at all. And if we did, it would be by way of Texas. Even in those days, I had a vivid imagination. Despite the borrowed blue jeans, the girls had trouble hopping a freight train. In fact, they never did learn how. And they never would. I decided after 12 hours of trying. I grabbed a freight that was moving slow, hoping that the girls would do the same. While I was looking back to see if they were going to be able to get on, I was knocked off by a switch. I finally got the girls onto a lumber car that was standing still. Since they couldn't learn how to hop, I went for the parked car. Once on board, the girls and I caught our breath for the trip northeast to Las Vegas, not knowing that the train went south to Los Angeles. We went right across the Mojave Desert, and we didn't even ride a boxcar. What kind of hobos were we, anyhow? We were out in the open on a flat car loaded with lumber. When the sun went down, the girls got cold. None of us had thought about how cold it would be after dark on an open, moving train car. None of us had a light jacket, and I wore only a short-sleeved cotton t-shirt. The girls wanted to sleep because they were tired and because they thought they wouldn't be as miserable. But they couldn't nod off in the breeze. I told them to lie still. Let me lie on top of one of them, and the other one can lie on top of me. At least I'd be warm. We became a human sandwich. I woke up at dawn. Mildred says she remembers rubbing the sleep from her eyes and seeing me walking and crawling on top of a boxcar ahead of the lumber car. My lofty perch was heaven on earth. There is something about moving that liberates me to this day, even though I sometimes get burnt out from all my traveling. In November 1997, a group of singers got together for a tribute to my music and me that aired on the Nashville Network. I was interviewed and asked to sum up my career in a few words. I only did it six. A 35-year bus ride Some folks think I was oversimplifying, but sometimes that's how I look at it. I'm on the run. The highway is my home. Liz Anderson wrote in 1966 as a line from I'm a Lost and Fugitive, my first number one song. I later wrote The Running Kind, a song that in essence says I've always been running for no particular reason. There is a restlessness in my soul that I've never conquered with motion or marriages. although I'm more satisfied today than ever. My yearning to travel is not as strong as it was when I was young. I've mellowed a lot, but it's still there to a degree, and it will be till the day I die. I finally decided. By nightfall, the train had pulled into the Los Angeles area. The girls stayed in the flat car while I took our pocket change to go for food. We hadn't eaten in several hours. Mildred later recalled how the girls went for 15 hours without peeing. I didn't think about their discomfort at the time because I could piss in the wind and relieve myself. I returned to the flat car from a tiny grocery store where I'd bought cigarettes, Campbell beans and bacon soup, peanut butter and bologna. And we had no can opener. It took a long time to open that can. Then we realized we had no spoons. The girls and I were hungry, famished. We ate the cold, thick soup right out of the can with our fingers. We each had a sandwich, leaving enough for a second sandwich apiece. We started walking into the night and came upon a little black car. I stole it. Just a little matter of popping the hood and some hot wiring and we were on our way. There were no inside car latches in those days and no alarm systems either. We were just having fun. In our young minds, we were party goers, not criminals. I'm sure we'd have known that what we were doing was wrong if we'd have stopped to think about it. But we had stopped thinking about the time we decided to take the trip. Fun, not felonies, was all we had on our minds. We were tired and Las Vegas seemed a long way off. We didn't get five miles before the stolen car ran out of gasoline. Those old cars had unreliable fuel gauges. So we got out and began to walk. The next car we saw had a police emblem on its side. It was illegal for 15-year-olds to be on the street at 2 a.m. Luckily, the stolen car was several blocks behind us, so the police never knew I'd taken it. Mildred was put into a room, Carol was put into another room, and I was put in a cell. I decided to play hard-ass and refused to give my name. It didn't matter. The girls gave theirs, and their names matched the missing persons report our parents had filed. You didn't have to wait three days in 1952, as you do today, to file on missing persons. Our parents drove from Bakersfield, and we were let go in our parents' custody. At 14, I was already familiar with legal terminology. None of us went to school for the next three days. That was fine with me. Once again, I was punished for skipping school by being kept home from school. Then my mom did something that revealed her financial struggle. I didn't appreciate the significance of this story until Mildred reminded me of it in October 1998. My mother and my sister Lillian went to Carol's parents' house and then to Mildred's. At each home, Mom asked for only one thing, the pants I had loaned the girls. I'm here after my boys' pants, she told the girls' parents. Back then, a pair of Levi's, or blue jeans, cost about $3.50. No way Mom could afford to buy two replacements. My song, Mama Tried, debuted on July 27, 1968, 16 years after my escapade with the girls. The song talks about my mom's nonstop struggle as a single parent pitted against my inner restlessness. In the early 1980s, I recorded an album called For the Mama That Tried, a collection of her favorite gospel songs. I did a lot for her, but I realize now that much of it was too little, too late. For years after Dad died, neither Mama or anybody else could tell me much. I thought I had all the answers. I hadn't even figured out the questions. Reporters and the general public have always been fascinated by my juvenile delinquency. Many have been taken by the fact that I'd been to prison. Johnny Cash had his own television show on ABC back in the 1960s. During my first appearance on it in 1968, he and I did a routine about one of his concerts inside San Quentin. That's funny, Hag. I don't remember you being on that show. I wasn't, John. I was in the audience. Folks told me that ABC got a lot of negative mail because it had an ex-convict on primetime variety show. Can you imagine what would happen today if I were 24, just out of prison, and trying to get a record deal in Nashville? When I got my deal, the labels were looking for artists with their own style. Today's homogenized country music is produced by a bunch of artists who sound like each other. No label would take a chance on my sound, especially with my personal background, if I were trying to start over. Back in 1951, when I was 14, Bunky's drive-in restaurant was Oildale's end place. Everybody came to see and be seen, although we had all seen each other many times. Most of us were too poor and too young, or both, to afford a car. So we walked to Bunky's and hung out. One night, I noticed a guy who, in retrospect, reminded me of Henry Fonda. I was especially intrigued with Bob Teague because he had been in the Marines for two years. He lied about his age and joined when he was 14. When he was found out at 16, he was immediately discharged. The fact that he had military background had pulled a fast one on the government, and was 18, made me admire him somewhat. When we got to talking at Bunkies, Bob said he'd heard that I could sing like Lefty Brazell. Bob told me that he could sing like Hank Williams, a statement that only raised my opinion of him. Bob said he would teach me how to play guitar. I tried to teach myself a few chords on an old Bronson guitar that my brother had brought home from his gasoline station. A customer had given it to him for $2 worth of gas. The thing was beating up pretty badly with strings that were too high off its crooked neck. Bob had an Epiphone guitar that belonged to his brother, and it was beautiful. He said I could play it if I liked, and the offer also included lessons. I spent a lot of time listening to the radio and couldn't have been more complimented when he said I sang like Lefty. Lefty was my favorite, and I didn't try to imitate him. I was just gifted with something of the same sort of sound. Lefty Frazell himself, Bob said, was going to play in Bakersfield's Rainbow Garden in a couple of weeks. I wanted to go. Boy, how I wanted to go. When the big night arrived, Bob and I rode in a borrowed car and took some beer. Before the show could begin, we got drunk and passed out on the lawn outside the garden. I wonder now why I wasn't arrested for public drunkenness. A kid my age snoring, surrounded by empty beer cans. I was shaken awake by someone shouting that we were missing the show. I looked up to see my brother-in-law, Bill Ray, someone who I admired very much. He said, you're missing the show. We got up and went in and caught what was left. During the show, I was distracted by Janine Hilton. I couldn't believe a girl like her from a two-parent family in a nice neighborhood agreed to dance with the likes of me. a boy with no dad from another part of town. My neighborhood's reputation was a little bit tainted, and my personal reputation was outright bad. I was lost in her feminine charms, says Janine, and I danced closely. But the spell was instantly broken when someone hollered, and now here's Lefty Frizzell. The crowd rushed to the bandstand, but I was just too short to see my idol when someone passed a chair to him. The audience in those days were very informal when they were on their best behavior and were outright dangerous when they were on their worst. Lefty knew instantly what was expected of him. He stood on it and raised his microphone. Now everyone in the place, including me, old shorty, could see him. Dressed in a white western suit, Lefty's charisma made him a human magnet. No one could look away, I guess. But how would I know? I didn't look at anybody but Lefty. I even forgot about Janine, who may have been still on my arm. Lefty ended his second set with Always Late. During that set, Lefty would introduce two of his classics, first being Always Late With Your Kisses, and the flip side, which was called Mom and Dad's Waltz. And I was so impressed because the song was for his mother and dad. And I remember a lump coming in my throat when he said that all the royalties from this song goes to my mother and my father. I thought, what a neat guy. The spell that Lefty cast that night sealed my disinterest in school. One day Bob Tigg asked if I'd like to join him on a trip to visit his grandfather in San Antonio. The idea of going to Texas had always been something I'd wanted to do. Texas was the home of Lefty Frizzell, Bob Wills, and the Texas Playboys. And Texas seemed like a faraway mecca to me because of those guys. I thought we'd just run into Wills and Lefty, kind of like a lot of tourists who go to Nashville each year. They flood the city with plastic cameras and a lot of them assuming that they're going to run into Alan Jackson and Garth Brooks and the ones that don't know country music probably think they're going to see Hank Senior. Somehow there is a wholesomeness to that kind of thinking, especially these days. Bob and I left town on a Greyhound bus, but it soon got boring and we got off and began to hitchhike. Once again, I was experiencing the thrill of travel. I had my thumb in the air, concrete beneath me, and Texas in my mind's eye. I pitied the kids who were back in school trying to name the first battle of the Civil War. We got a ride with a guy who let us off in a Amarillo where Bob took me to buy some cowboy boots and a western hat. Both were secondhand, but I didn't care. They looked good. Now any man can tell you the first time he drove a car. He can tell you the first time he fell in love. And men more than women can remember in precise detail their first sexual experience. Mine was in Amarillo at a whorehouse. Bob Tigg took me to the Texas Hotel, which looked kind of drab on the outside and was decorated much like a riverboat should be. The only thing absent was the river, but I wasn't thinking about water. I'd never seen such heavily painted women or women sitting around in various stages of undress. Each time I looked at a girl, she was already looking at me. I figured I must have stood out, and I was terrified that the girls and Bob would know that this was my first time. I wasn't afraid of sex, just afraid of somebody thinking it was my first time. But I thought, I'm a man of the world. Hadn't I just hitchhiked halfway across the country? I remember that none of the girls wanted anything to do with me because they said I was too young. My eyes locked with those of a heavyset woman in an electric pink dress. She probably lumbered up to me, but it seemed as if she glided. I later decided she was the madam. The other girls were probably afraid of being charged with statutory rape. But not that madam. She took me upstairs herself. I watched in fascination as she undressed and let her clothes fall to the floor, creating a pool of pink that glowed almost as much as the blush on my face. The whole thing didn't last very long, but I'd remember it for a lifetime. Bob and I resumed our hitchhiking, determined to get to Big Springs, Texas, where we planned to knock on Lefty Prezell's door. In the modern music business, we would have been called germs. That's what people in country music call fans who go from enjoyment to worship and pester the celebrity who is the target of their affection. We were hot, tired, and dirty when our last ride dropped us off in Big Springs. No one could direct us to Lefty's house. I might have thought the town was the biggest collection of dumb people I'd ever seen. Believe you me, if Lefty Brazell had lived in my town, I could have told you his address and the dimensions of his lawn. But not only did Lefty not live in my town, he didn't live in Big Springs. We had the right state and the wrong town. We'd come 1,500 miles to find that out. I wondered what made Bob so certain Big Springs was left his hometown, but I don't remember asking him. I just remember the disappointment with the guy who I admired so much at the time. We resumed our journey to Grandpa Tigg's house in San Antonio, but now we'd gone through almost all of the $180 with which we had begun the trip. With the little we had left, we decided to get a room, and somehow we found work for the next morning building fences. Our room was upstairs from a honky-tonk. I probably could have fallen asleep to the sound of music, but I couldn't sleep to the sound of breaking glass and busting furniture. And I'll tell you what, the heat was so damn bad in those days without air conditioning, that was the real problem. So, Bob and I overslept and we were late for our first day on the job. We were fired without ever seeing an inch of the fence. We went on to Bob's grandpa's house, where we stayed about two weeks before the old man got tired of us, and he took us down to the railroad yard, bought us a pound of bologna and gave us $5 and two loaves of bread. And he said, now, boys, you know what you do with this? And Bob and I both looked at him, said, no, grandpa. And he said, eat the shit out of it. We took that good advice and hopped a train, this time en route to Los Angeles. We got off in El Paso. We shouldn't have. We had wanted to hitchhike because we were bored with the rails. A motorist picked us up and soon picked up a third hitchhiker in the car. Bob showed him a gun he had bought in New Mexico, and after the guy got out, the cops detained him. An unbeknownst to us, someone had robbed a nearby liquor store. When questioned about seeing anyone suspicious, the hitchhiker told the cops about Bob and me and the gun. That's all it took. A manhunt was underway. Bob and I were standing by the road with our thumbs outraged. I don't recall which of us saw the first squad car, but suddenly it began raining policemen. They kept screaming that they'd got us. One hit me with a blackjack and my head throbbed as I was thrown into a back of a police car. Bob and I watched the rear window as the cops emptied our suitcases along the highway. We were just outside L.A. If we'd hitched one more ride, we'd have avoided all this. One of the cops yelled, I found it, as Bob's pistol fell out of the suitcase and onto the pavement. And then came my switchblade knife. I had a fake I.D. on me that said I was 18. Because of it, I was arrested as an adult. And it was the first time, but it wouldn't be the last. If you were to look at my rap sheet, you'd find that we'd been arrested for strong-arm robbery. Not suspicion of strong-arm robbery, but strong-arm robbery. That looks pretty bad, when in fact, we never were. Bob and I stayed in jail for five days, and it seemed like a full year. The real robbers were caught. The charges against us were dropped, and we were released. but it doesn't say that on my rap sheet. I wish the cops that had taken us in had been the ones who'd let us go, but it didn't happen that way. The jailer who said we were free didn't even apologize. We got out of jail at about 5 o'clock in the afternoon. It was Lincoln Heights Jail there. They fed twice a day, and they let us out just before chow time. And Bob and I had a total of 16 cents in our pocket. And we walked from Lincoln Heights all the way to San Fernando, and I've gauged it since then. It's about 30 miles. We got out there about 2 o'clock in the morning, and we saw this donut truck delivering pastry. And we went up, and we bought 16 cents worth of yesterday's donuts from this guy, and ate every one of them, and we threw up in about 20 minutes. And then we made our way on to Oildale, where my mother was waiting for me and wondering where I'd been. We walked from the highway to my mom's house, where mom told us both over and over how glad she was we were home. I kept waiting for her scolding for taking off, but it never came. Maybe she was kind, simply because she was glad I was safe. Or maybe she was beginning to realize that nothing she could say or do would do any good. I was going to come and go as I pleased, so she fussed over me and made me breakfast. A person doesn't always remember what they ate when they were 14 years old, but I remember eating a half a dozen eggs and a side of bacon and about a half a loaf of bread and some peanut butter and syrup to fill the platter that morning. When school started up again, I attended class for nine days, then I stopped going. The truant officer again hauled me off to the juvenile hall. I didn't like it there any more than I liked school. The only place I wanted to be was anywhere except where I was. So once again, six years before reaching 21, I took off. Again, my companion was Bob Teague. That time, we went north to Modesto. We got jobs as day laborers loading hay. Went to work for a couple named Slim Rayford and his wife. Trouble was, we did a week's worth of work about every two days. We bucked hay from 7 o'clock in the morning to 10 in the evening, five days a week. We worked until noon on Saturdays. We earned a dollar and a quarter an hour, plus a room and our food. I thought about returning to school or juvenile hall, but not for long. The fact that I was willing to do such back-breaking work rather than attend class should give you an idea of how much I hated school. As I told you, we worked for a man named Slim Rayford. Slim gave us a day off, and we had lots of energy. So we went out to this old beer joint called the Fun Center, which we'd heard featured country music. In fact, there was no music going on at all. There was just an old guitar and a microphone sitting over in the corner. On our way to the place, Bob and I pulled some money and bought an old guitar that cost five dollars. Nobody was going to mistake it for a Martin D-45, I'll tell you that. But our guitar wasn't nearly as bad as the one inside the fun center. It looked as if it had been beaten harder than some of the customers. This was a knife and gun club, where both sometimes yielded to a wooden bat kept under the bar. The joint was filled with people that looked like they didn't hold a job at anything. They were pretty good at setting up the bar and drinking beer. The place had concrete floors and it had concrete block walls and bar stools with uneven legs. Bob and I walked in and I had this guitar strapped on my back. Before long, a customer asked me if I could play it. I said, well, a little bit. The guy asked me to play. I walked to the corner where no bandstand was. And there was an old microphone there. We began to look around, and sure enough, you could hook it up and play it, make it work. Bob picked up a battered guitar. I hit a chord on ours. We broke into lefties. Always late with your kisses. Of course. Bob followed with Hank Williams' You're Cheatin' Heart. Of course. Those songs were the predictable part of our repertoire. I've played for dead audiences in my life, although not for very long, if I could manage it. But those folks would have put caffeine to sleep. They were more lifeless than delegates to a mortician's convention. Four songs into our set, we could tell that the people were paying attention and enjoying what we were doing. Then the bartender offered us $5 to play for the rest of the night. Before we could say yes, he threw in all the free beer we could drink. It was my first paying job as a musician. I didn't even have to spend my paycheck to get drunk, because the drunk was free. I'll remember that job forever, one of the most thrilling experiences of my life. People who don't play music have no idea how great it feels to play it right. To play it right while getting paid is the all-time natural high. After Bob and I finished out the hay season, I returned to Oildale as I always did. School had long been underway, and I suppose I could have enrolled. But I didn't bother starting something I knew I'd quit. So in no time, I was grabbed again by the truant officer. I was returned to Juvenile Hall. The place had become my second home to such an extent that I kept my phonograph records there. I guess I spent a lot of time there in those days. I even spent my 14th birthday locked up in Juvenile Hall. My mother came on Christmas Day with a Martin guitar. That was the first one I ever owned. She was my only visitor, and that was my only gift. But what a great gift. God, I loved that guitar Mama bought. God, I hated to leave it. But the old rambling fever took over again. Soon I was planning what would be my first escape with one of my buddies. We were being held in what was called the New Juvenile Hall. And because I had no prior record of running at the time, they didn't mind putting us in there when it was incomplete. Some of the things, like bars over the windows, hadn't been done yet. So we found this window that was made up of chicken wire that was sandwiched between two pieces of glass. And while the ping pong games and the different things people were doing in the day room was going on, my friend and I grabbed this big bench, and we made a run at that chicken wire, and it run all the way through. Then we came back and made our run at it. He and I had both been in tumbling classes in the 6th, 7th, and 8th grades, so we did our tumbling act. Out the window, on the sidewalk, perfect rolls, up on our feet. We ran about 400 yards, roughly the length of four football fields, actually, to a chain-link fence surrounding the facility. Every time I turned around, I saw lights flickering on, and I could see people running after me. I rested on top of the fence, and it cut the front of my shirt and into my skin, and I carried a scar for many years. Then I jumped off the other side of the fence, and I fell about what I thought was about 25 feet. The school ground was about 12 feet, but someone had dug a hole on the other side, and I fell into some mud, just like in a bad dream. I finally made my way out of it, but I was safe and unharmed. And me and my friend made our way to what was known as China Grade Loop Bluff. Off the cliff, we stumbled and we fell and finally made our way to the bottom, which led us to the edge of Kern River. Kern River in this particular area was only about a foot, maybe two feet deep, and was awfully wide, and we figured, quite shallow. We found that not to be true. As we tried to make our way across the river that night, we fell in many holes we had to swim out of. I think maybe that's where the song Kern River may have come from in some way. After crossing the river, Bobby Cox went home to his family and I went home to mine and it wasn't long before they came and took us both back. And then they sent me to what was the same as a road camp for men, but it was called Camp Owens, and it was sort of a road camp-like deal where you dug ditches during the day and you slept at night, and if you did anything else, they'd beat the shit out of you. And I stayed five days there. And me and another kid named Bobby, not the same Bobby, left that joint and got us a 1949 Lincoln in a little town in the mountains there and made our way down the Kern Canyon. And I never will forget that night. I had to stop and take a crap. I don't know how else to say it. And we were speeding out the canyon and stopped on the side of the road. And Bob said, hurry up. And I went around to the back bumper, and sure enough, here come some lights. And it wasn't the policemen. It was a carload of women, and they pulled right up to me and honked their horns and blinked their lights while I got my clothes up and scurried back into the car. If you drive over the speed limit enough, you're eventually going to get arrested. If you commit adultery enough, you'll eventually be found out and divorced by your spouse. If you're threatened enough about the consequences of fleeing juvenile hall, ultimately the threats will be made good. It happened to me. In February 1952, less than two months after my 15th birthday, I was remanded to the custody of the California Youth Authority, CYA, for 18 months. I stepped from the car in handcuffs outside Fred C. Nellis School for Boys in Whittier. I was one of 20 new inmates, and that's what I was, because I was no longer the ward of the school system. I was the ward of the state. I was a juvenile inmate. New inmates would lodge in one of nine cottages, each of which was named after a U.S. president. I was assigned to Lincoln Cottage. The cottage supervisor's skin was wrinkled enough that he could have held a playing card between the wrinkles. The other inductees named him Pruneface because his face did look like a prune. It was red and it was wrinkled. And it was very well built because he lifted weights. I'll say one thing about Pruneface. He didn't discriminate. He hated all boys equally. What a pathetic life he led, spending each day overseeing the lives of boys he hated but never bothered to get to know. We new inmates stood in formation as Pruneface walked among us like a drill instructor. He stopped directly in front of me and looked me up and down. His eyes were dead, like a snake's. And he stood so close to me that I could smell his breath. He bent his beefy middle finger and punched me in the chest, right above my breastbone. My uniform bore a patch where he liked to hit people. The patch was his target, he said, because it enabled him to hit people right where it hurt the most. Pruneface punched me several times, but I didn't flinch. The man had obviously done this to other boys. Then he hit me again. Then he hit me each time he said a word. And he was talking nonstop. Pruneface had no idea I was listening to his ranting without hearing a thing. I was already thinking about how I was going to get out. I wanted to do a visual survey of the place, but I knew he'd knock me to the ground if I as much as looked one way or the other. I was supposed to stare directly in front of me, but not make eye contact with him. Anyone who's ever stood in the military formation knows what I mean. I attempted four escapes, an average of one every four and a half months. One I made to the fence, one I made over the fence, and one I made all the way to my house in Bakersfield. Even though it was much harder to break out of California's penal institution than it was Oildale's school district, I somehow handled the job. It was at Fred C. Nella's school that I saw firsthand how men of authority arbitrarily beat their subjects. And I had another sadistic supervisor. He would inspect the making of our beds every morning after getting out of bed. We were given five minutes, no more, to get up. There was no bell, no siren, no trumpet, just the lights came on. And you had those five minutes to get your bed made and get yourself at attention and look straight ahead. We stood in detention, and he would check our nightgowns to see if they were hanging correctly. And he had on boots with taps, and I can remember he walked always from behind us, where you couldn't see what he was going to do and who he was going to slap next. But I remember this one morning, I was standing in detention, and I must have moved my head a slight bit, because he hit me upside the head and slapped me over a bunk, and I fell in the floor. And he said, good morning. Ducking was out of the question. He had his swing down to an art. Although I was assigned to Lincoln Cottage, I didn't spend much time there. I spent most of my time in Disciplinary Cottage. I never asked when President Disciplinary held office. I took seven buddies on my first attempt at escape from the Disciplinary Cottage. I must have thought there was strength in numbers. We were working in the Nellis yard, which meant the only thing between freedom and us was a 12-foot chain-link fence. We decided which guy would give the command, and he did. As I look back, we should have had a silent signal. As it was, he shouted, hit it. And that alerted the guards. We sprinted for the fence nevertheless. I made it all the way to the top, but somebody got a hold of my foot, and that was the end of that one. I was one of four boys sent to the sadistic guard for punishment. He marched us into the blacktop courtyard. Running on blacktop hurts your legs and aches more than running on dirt. You boys want to run, he yelled. Well, God damn it, run. He ran us till we dropped, then kicked us to our feet and made us run some more. I was suffering from exhaustion and sliding inside my boots, because my boots, you see, were size 11 and I wear a size 7. I ran until blisters formed and then broke. The inside of my boots were soaked with sweat and blood. So when the blisters popped, my raw flesh was rubbed against wet leather. The pain was overwhelming. The only thing holding my shoes to my feet were the laces that had been wrapped around my legs. By now the laces were cutting into the skin, and I was sure blood was running down my legs. I couldn't stop to see how serious I might be bleeding, so against my better judgment, I told him. Keep running, you little bastard, was the only reply, screamed directly in my ear. I could go on no longer. After about three and a half hours, I simply stopped. I ain't running another goddamn step,\" I told him. He stared at me in disbelief, and I replayed my words in my mind, also in disbelief. Then he smirked at me and assured me that I would run some more. He began beating me from behind with a rake, nearly knocking me down. I thought about letting myself collapse, but I didn't want to be on the ground so that he could swing vertically at me with that thing. Run, you little bastard, he yelled, running beside me and beating me endlessly with that rake. I was probably five foot seven at the time. I could still buy my clothes in the boys' department. And this maniac was going to beat me and run me to my death. I was sure of it. The guards weren't my only problem at Nellis. I also had problems with the other residents. I hesitate to call them inmates, but that's what they were. The place was overrun with groups that were more like gangs. The Mexicans, the blacks, drug dealers, other groups that hung out together. The whites never stuck together and never stuck up for anybody that was white. Prisons and other places of confinement are very clannish, except for the whites. I belonged to no one's group, and therefore I was a setting target for all of them. I got the hell beat out of me on the football field by 15 Mexicans. The reason I know there was 15, because that's how many was in the company. And they beat me to the ground and kicked me. And they kicked me well, but they never touched me. They thought they were kicking me. They were only kicking each other's feet. I bundled up in a ball and somehow stayed safe. Talking after lights were turned out was prohibited. Nonetheless, I was whispering to a kid in the bunk next to mine one night before I drifted off to sleep. My hand touched the floor, and I was awakened by the feel of something sticky on my fingers. I became fully conscious about the time someone landed his knees squarely in my back. The sticky stuff was blood of the kid to whom I'd been talking. The knee belonged to his assailant, who had stabbed the boy many times. Out of pure instinct, I straightened my back out so quick that it threw the guy completely off of me and over a bunk or two. And that's when I saw the knife. Back when I was doing time, there's a night I can't forget. A madman with a knife in hand tried to kill me while I slept. Somehow the knife missed its mark. and I penned The Raging Man. Somehow my mama's prayers worked again. I wrote those words years later as the opening to Mama's Prayers, a song about how Mama's pleading with God repeatedly saved my life. There's no other explanation for my having survived so many near-death experiences. That night at Nellis, I leapt from my bed and pulled the blanket with me. I held it at arm's length between me and the black guy with a knife. My buddy was still in a puddle of blood, lying on the floor. The crazed black man kept stabbing and slashing the blanket. He was out of his mind with rage. Otherwise, he would have stripped the blanket from my hands, given himself an open and probably a fatal shot at me. We were locked inside of a cage, a wire cage, with a catwalk on the outside for the guards to watch us through. For 45 minutes, I kept this man at bay, till finally someone came with a key and got in there and got him, and got him off of me. I knew who he was. His name was Reddix. He eventually died in the gas chamber at San Quentin for killing a man. I was almost sliced to death with a knife before I was old enough to own a shaving razor. I've been invited to perform at the White House. I've headlined in Las Vegas and the world's largest concert halls. And I can't count the times I've appeared on primetime television. I've often wondered if some of the heads of state who graciously received me would have done so if they'd have known about my lawless past. I'd escaped from juvenile halls, I'd escaped from Fred C. Nellis' school, and I'd escaped from just about everywhere I'd been, Camp Owens, simply because I didn't believe that I deserved to be there. And it became a challenge. I also couldn't stand the confinement and being told what to do, and I didn't like the way they treated the boys. Another reason was I thought if I stayed there, I would surely die there. And I didn't want to die, not before turning 15. Years later, when I saw Paul Newman in Cool Hand Luke, I thought, you know, some of that reminds me of my young life. Newman's character escaped his work detail on the road gang by blending in with others and simply walking away. He didn't make the mistake I'd made at Nellis of sprinting openly for the fence. One day, when the other residents and I were working this field, I too simply walked away. I took no one with me and I didn't yell. I just sort of faded into my surroundings. The guard didn't notice me because he was focused on a herd of bodies. I slowly ambled fifty yards from his viewpoint, then a hundred. By that time, I could drop to my knees and let the other workers pass me. The guard followed the group. Once I was safely out of his sight, I ran like hell and didn't stop until I was several miles from Nellis. I quickly stole an old 1937 Ford, and I made my way after hours of being lost in Los Angeles and not knowing where I was at, somehow wound up in a town called Indio. My absence had been noticed, and the California Highway Patrol had been alerted. And I made a mistake by trying to bury myself in the basement of a packing shed. I knew the cops would come for me, but I didn't expect a posse. So I decided to hide myself and do a good job of it. I buried myself alive, leaving little more than my nostrils above the ground. I stayed there, and then I slept. When I woke to the sound of angry voices, they belonged to the cops I had expected. But it was worse. Searching for me with flashlights were about 20 vigilantes, furious men who were determined to take the law and the lawless into their own hands. I've already told you about once being picked up and jailed for five days for robbery that I didn't commit. This time, I was sought for rape and murder that I didn't commit. The vigilantes had been told that a man fitting my description had been seen by a highway patrolman fleeing towards the shed. I heard one of the men say they were bound to catch me. Another said he would kill me himself. When the self-appointed posse walked away, never seeing me, tucked far underneath the shed and dirt, I bolted for the highway. I hoped I'd find a cop, and I got lucky. Can you believe that I, a repeat runaway, thought I was lucky in finding a highway patrolman? He made one pass on the road, saw me, and I knew he was going to turn around. Sure enough, he did. He came back and picked me up, and I sure was glad. When I told the officer that I was the escapee from Nellis that he was looking for, he stared at me with disbelief. He told me in great detail about the rape and the murder of 48 hours ago. He read me the description of the suspect, and it sounded like a verbal portrait of me. He was aware of the vigilantes, who were the victims' father, brothers, and neighbors. This neat highway patrol guy said, you know, you're really a lucky boy. And you really do look like that guy. I said, what guy? And he said, the guy that they were looking for looked just like you. And they found him just minutes or about an hour ago, in fact, and made a positive identification. You know, if they'd have caught you a while ago, they'd have killed you. So I guess it's back to Nellis with you. It was then the officer rolled down his window, probably so he wouldn't smell me, as we rode silently back to Nellis. Before I turned 16, I was transferred to Preston School of Industry. It was a higher security facility, after which residents were supposed to get vocational training. I got a job in the school dairy. Perhaps they thought they were training me to be a milkman. Preston was made of solid brick, and it had more guards than Nellis. And it was definitely more secure, and it took me about, oh, I think six months to escape. You hear a lot these days about how America has lost its innocence. People say Norman Rockwell's nation is dead. They're always comparing the country with the way it rallied behind the troops during World War II and how it rallied again during the Korean conflict. I've heard people say that back in the 50s we didn't even have to lock our doors. I've heard people say why we didn't even take our keys out of our cars. I got a response to that. Preston School of Industry was situated near Ion, California. Not exactly a thriving metropolis, right? It was small-town America. Straight out of Jimmy Stewart's It's a Wonderful Life. Maybe even smaller. About 4 a.m., I was walking in its squeaky-clean streets, lined with wood-framed houses whose residents were fast asleep. In minutes, the milkmen and the paperboys would come along. I walked into a yard and saw a car with windows down and reached inside for the ignition. Sure enough, the keys were there. Neighbors, I thought, it's really nice to be among trusting folks like you. I eased into the car with my PSI escapee buddy, Rick. We didn't even close the door so as to ensure our silence. I started the engine slowly, released the clutch, and probably attained a getaway speed of five miles per hour. The car jolted to a stop, so suddenly I almost went through the windshield. The owner had used a log chain to tie the axle to a towering oak. He feared PSI escapees might try to steal his vehicle. Sure enough, he was right. What kind of trust is that? It was getting so nobody believed in anybody. And why the log chain? Was he trying to anchor his car to the tree or the tree to the car? The noise awakened the guy inside, who of course called the cops. Rick and I lay under the man's house all day and chuckled at the parade of squad cars. For the first time in my criminal career to become worthy of a helicopter. My breakout prompted more activity there in that little town than they'd seen in years. Late that afternoon, the man at the house walked outdoors. Rick and I could see his feet. Another set of big feet approached his. We could hear the mouths that went with the feet. The second man asked the homeowner where he thought the escapees might be. The owner said we were probably miles away. A third pair of feet joined the other two. They were the feet of a kid so short I could see a toy pistol strapped to his waist. He kept nagging his dad about where the escaped bad boys might be hiding. His dad kept blowing him off and finally became annoyed. He told the kid to be quiet because, for all he knew, the bad boys were hiding right underneath the house and might jump out and grab him. Would you believe? The kid took his old man seriously. The kid got on his hands and knees and crawled under the house with his pistol. When his eyes met ours, I think all three of us peed our pants. He screamed and the grown-ups rallied, and my pal and I crawled out from under the house with our hands in the air. The only gun trained on us was made out of plastic and loaded with paper caps. But we couldn't have outrun the posse of neighbors that instantly assembled. In those days, people spent a lot of time in the yards. It was mostly a pre-air-conditioned society. We were arrested and put in handcuffs. They weren't plastic. Once again, I felt steel bite into my wrists. I've already told you about my first sexual experience that was purely sex and was a whole lot better for me, I'm sure, than it was for her. I was inexperienced and quick. I think it's time I tell you about the first time I made love. I finished my time at PSI. They had so many guards watching me that the other inmates could have juggled straight razors and no one would have noticed. My first love was Dolly. I'm not talking about Dolly Parton. Although, some years later, I had a great infatuation with her. I even wrote a song for her called, Always Wanting You. Actually, I wrote two songs that morning, somewhere between 3 and 4 a.m. And I called her to sing both of them, to her, in person. And it was, I guess, February 15th, 1974, the tune, Always Wanting You, went to number one. The sleeper person who was answering the phone said Dolly was asleep. I said, well, go wake her up. She said, well, she's way down underneath the cover. I said, well, go way down underneath the cover and get her out. Tell her to come to the phone. And I sang both the songs for her on the phone. And she was so sweet. She didn't get mad at me or nothing. She tolerated my stupidity. Anyhow, back to my first dolly, whose last name I won't reveal. I may have taken her virginity, and her eventual husband may think the same thing. Virginity was a precious gift for a woman to give to a man in 1953. I guess my dolly was ahead of her time. She had sex with me at 16. Dolly was not exactly well-behaved in any area of her life. Mostly, youngsters back then met in school or church. Dolly and I had met at juvenile hall. She didn't like to go to school either. I'd been discharged from PSI, Preston School of Industry, and was back in my hometown in Oildale. I was working inside a packing shed doing well. In the spring of the year, I could work in the potatoes, and they were everywhere around Bakersfield. I was working in the shed and was making a real good check for a boy 16 years old. I made about $150 a week. I got off work on Friday and had to ride a city bus from Oildale to the east side of Bakersfield, where the processing potato sheds were situated along the railroad track at an area that was known as Edison Highway. On the bus, I spotted a girl I'd known from detention hall. She and I had made eyes at each other, never thinking we'd ever touch, because she was on the girls' side and I was on the boys', and there was bars in between. There was a magnetic pull. We felt it inside detention hall, and sure enough, we had run smack into each other. She said she'd also just got off work at Tiny's Waffle Shop, and she said she had some money and wanted to live her life on her own. Are you tired of Bakersfield? I asked. Boy, I sure am, she said. But I'm on probation. I'm on probation, too. How would you like to go to, say, Eugene, Oregon or someplace? That would be nice, she said. She told me that the train left Bakersfield at 1 a.m. She thought we could get to the station in time to buy a ticket. I thought she was joking. She was beautiful. She looked like a combination of Julia Roberts and Cher. Dolly and I got on the train, and that was my first time to really make love to a woman. What a woman. We didn't realize anybody else was on the train. We got after it right in the chair. We must have been a sight. It's a wonder we didn't get arrested. It was a 22-hour ride, and we made love the majority of the 22 hours. And we got off, and we got off, and finally got off at Eugene. We had no idea what we was going to do for a living. Didn't worry about that. Sure enough, there was another tiny's waffle shop that was hooked up to a chain that went all the way through Oregon, Washington, and California. She went back to work for them and I went to work at a produce house unloading bananas. I don't remember anything bad about our relationship except that Dolly and I got along so well that the slightest little thing set me off. There was a guy next door who was obviously gay. I had nothing against gays. I'd been in jail and other confinement. I treated the man the way I wanted to be treated. He mistook that for the fact that I might be gay, too. I've never discriminated against anybody, and I never hated blacks, Mexicans, or Chinese, or anybody else. Although, I've come to despise attorneys, but they earned it. This guy who mistook my demeanor invited me to supper. Dolly had a key to the house, and I didn't, and couldn't get inside. And we lived in a duplex. Our neighbor offered me some supper while I waited for Dolly to come home from work. Simple enough. Innocent enough. I was hungry and I could smell the food. Spaghetti. So I said I'd come in and eat. I set my lunch pail in front of the door so Dolly would know that I was home. And I sat down and he filled up my glass with some wine. And I drank the first glass fast because I was thirsty. The man offered me more wine. As he came down with the glass, his beard touched me from behind. He was over my shoulder. And then he tried to kiss me. What happened next was so quick that I don't remember exactly how it occurred. The kiss struck me the wrong way. I hit him, and it was just like in the movies. He went up against this ice box and withered down to the floor. I threw only one blow. I think it was a lift. The wine and spaghetti went everywhere. About that time, I stormed out of his house as Dolly was coming up to the porch. What the hell happened? she asked. I told her, and she acted as if she wanted to check out my story. I always took immediate offense to that, and I'm still that way. If somebody doesn't believe me, it really bothers me. So I ask her, you don't believe me, do you? Not really. I think he's too nice a guy. I walked over to the ironing board and started taking money out of my pockets. I gave her all I had. I took one quarter and one dime for myself. Then I walked out the door, said, I'll see you. It's been really nice. I'll talk to you later. Well, I haven't seen her to this day, and I don't know whether she's dead or alive. I wish she'd come forward and contact some of my people, let me know. I'd just like to say hi or howdy. I walked out of our duplex apartment onto what was a main boulevard in Eugene, and I could see a freight train slowly crossing about three blocks away. I thought, you know, I think I can make that train. And it was heading the right direction, so I took off running. Sure enough, I got there and was able to grab a gondola. But that was really cold, and we were climbing into the mountains. We stopped somewhere for a moment, and I got off and climbed up into this reefer. We got down into an ice compartment. I say we because it was me and a couple other hobos. It was cold. We got down inside the ice compartment. Let me tell you, it was some ride over the mountains that night. We finally made it into Klamath Falls. It was there that I jumped off and hopped another train, headed south. People ask if I could hop a freight train today. I honestly think I still could. In fact, I did it the other day just to make sure I could. It's like riding a bicycle or flying an airplane. Once you learn how to do it, you pretty much remember the main things. I pulled myself into an open boxcar and let my eyes adjust to the light. And the thing was filled with hobos. Eight in all, I think. They wanted to know why I wasn't in school. And I wanted to ask, well, why aren't you at work? But I had better sense and better manners. I had long ago learned to respect my elders, especially those who were on the bum and needed help. One of the men that appeared to be the eldest kind of grinned and tossed a pouch of tobacco and some rolling papers across the floor to me. When I looked into his face, my eyes locked with some of the kindest eyes I'd ever seen. They glowed, they smiled, and they were all-knowing. His eyes looked as if they'd seen it all, pools of a poor man's wisdom. The men continued their small talk, which was mostly directed at me. Someone so young riding the rails, I'm sure they thought I was wasting my life, because most of them had done the same thing when they were my age. Look at what it got them. I made a comment to one of the men that I was hungry, that I intended to rob one of those food cars as soon as this train stopped. And almost in unison, the hobos barked at me not to break the seal on any food car. It was a federal offense. They didn't particularly care about my height, but they didn't want a railroad detective coming down on them. They said, boy, they'll give you 50 years. In those days, railroad dicks sometimes looked the other way if a transit rode the rails without breaking any laws. But if you broke into a car with a seal on it, they'd come down on you. Or at least that's what the hobos thought. The train jerked to a stop. I jumped out and walked across only a few cars when I came to the one I wanted, Mark Food. Down the ladder, to the ground, and over to the door. Break the seal. Inside, loaded with canned foods, one lone case of green beans sat on top of the entire stack of a perfectly fitted boxcar. I saw it, grabbed it, and was about to leave when I seen the shadow of a man walking on top. I said, oh my God, it's a railroad detective, sure as the world. And I was right. And he yelled out, he said, close that damn door when you come out of there. I did what the man told me. I closed the door and left with my case of green beans. I ran back to the boxcar and threw it up inside, and those hobos had a fit. One threatened to whip my ass, and he said, you know, we could all go to the penitentiary on account of you. Then one of the old men, who had been speechless, held up his hand like an aged Indian tribal leader. And the other seven became quiet. He said, open up them beans, son, as he threw me an old rusty can opener. And I threw him back a can of beans. He said, I'd be proud to eat some with you, son. Don't worry about these chicken-livered assholes. But now you're probably wondering if I ever did anything except travel illegally or run from the law as a young man. Well, I did work for a living, and I did some other things, but I set myself in motion at 10, and I've been moving ever since. Back to the trip with a boxcar filled with green beans. I waked and found myself alone inside a boxcar. I rolled off the stop train and began walking. It was almost daylight when I saw a distant sign that said Dunsmire and Greyhound Bus Station. Once inside, I found out that it was a mountain town called Dunsmire, California, just south of Oregon. I was hungry again. Someone was frying breakfast in the bus diner. With only 25 cents, I decided it'd have to do with just coffee. A kind waitress who looked as if she'd eaten plenty of meals refused to take my money. Her generosity stopped at the coffee. There was no mention of free food. I sure as hell wasn't going to ask her for any. I asked for change for a quarter, and she gave me five nickels. I could call home, collect the 10 cents, and I did just that, knowing that Mom would be cooking breakfast, too. Mom accepted the call and wired some money to the Western Union. Soon, I had myself a clean T-shirt and a new pair of Levi's and a ticket to Bakersfield. I remember the sound of nickels dropping into the telephone and the sound of Mama's voice. As hungry and as far away as I was, I remember even more a jukebox, dropping two nickels into it, and playing Hey Good Lookin' by Hank Williams. I talked to Mom while Hank sang to me. I had a musical idol in my ear, my mother on the line, an arrangement to get home, and five cents to my name. It all meant one more first chance for Merle Haggard. I don't think there's much point in telling more stories about my illicit travels. You get the idea. There was plenty more trips, just different places and different faces, but for the same reason, the inner restlessness. I tried to flee, but it always awaited me when I arrived. I had a lot of fun, and I was too young to realize the price I was having to pay for it. I even had peace of mind. Most people in my generation can tell you exactly where they were the day John F. Kennedy was shot, the day man first walked on the moon, and the day Elvis died. Many can also tell you the first time they ever saw a telephone or a television. The two inventions that transformed the 20th century life more than anything else, including computers. My recollection of where I first saw television is as boring as anybody else's. I'm much more excited about what I saw on television. Music. Live music. I'd heard it on the radio and in the dives that I was often too young to enter. And I'd played it for small and often captive audiences. Right there in Bakersfield, I could watch the Billy Myers Show on Channel 29, the first television station in the San Joaquin Valley. I think the year was 1953. Almost all television was done live in those days. Lewis Talley had a local television show, and I watched all the shows, Lewis Talley's, Billy Myers', Buck Owens' shows, as well as Cousin Herb Henson's shows. They all came on the air in 1953 and 1954. I thought all these people were big celebrities. It never dawned on me that every town with a television station had their own local talent, the way every town with a radio station featured live entertainment in the 1920s through the 1950s. Even the Grand Ole Opry, the world's longest running live radio show, started out as a local broadcast over WSM radio in 1926. In Bakersfield, Louis was indisputably the biggest star. I mean, the guy had his own television show, a record company, a music publishing company, and he had a lot of knowledge and common sense for a man as young as he was. I think he was only like 29 years old at the time. Of course, most of those entities didn't reach much beyond Bakersfield. But then, neither did my dreams. Louis ran his empire with his cousin, Fuzzy Owen. I'll never forget the first time I met the two of them. I was 17. I'd hung around some of the dance halls in the area, places like Hurry Back Inn and The Blackboard and Lucky Spot, and then there was a place called Doc's Club, I think. And although I was too young, I'd slip in and watch these guys play. It increased my thirst to be part of this art that was called beer joint music at the time, not country music. When I came up in the business, we were required to play almost every kind of music. We had to play rock and roll. We had to play some jazz. We had to play swang. We had to know the difference between 1940 music and 1950 music. We played blues. We played just about everything there was, calypso. We played different sorts of dances. Unless you were capable of playing all of that kind of music, you just didn't work in Bakersfield, because those clubs were full of really good bands. So I got my courage together, and I went to Lewis Talley's studio to play my songs. And you know what? He liked them. I didn't say a word, largely because I couldn't. I was speechless with gratitude. Then he played them for Fuzzy, who dampened my spirits. He said I sounded too much like Win Stewart or Lefty Frizzell, and pointed out that the world already had both of those boys. Lewis would eventually throw it in Fuzzy's face. He would say, you know, the first time you heard Merle Haggard, you said he sounded too much like Win Stewart, Electric Frizzell, until you owned all the company. Then you signed him, Lewis told Fuzzy. I knew that something was wrong when you said you didn't like his singing. Then, right after that, all I heard about from you was Merle Haggard. My timing for pitching myself as a country artist wasn't at its best. I might add it's never been any better since. From Lewis and Fuzzy, I'd gotten a listen and a warning from Lewis that Fuzzy was probably right. I did sound too much like those other artists back then. Fuzzy was polite but firm. He told me that perhaps we could go do some business in the future, but not today. And I interpreted that to mean that one day I might be on Tally Record label, and time would prove me right. I continued to watch local television and country music. There was an up-and-coming artist named Buck Owens who dominated country music from the late 50s throughout the 1970s in a way that few artists ever have. But in 1952, Buck was a local star in Bakersfield, along with his pretty wife, Bonnie. I'd eventually marry Bonnie myself, but not before marrying another woman first. Bonnie's a fine harmony singer, and she's still part of my show today. Bakersfield was getting quite a reputation for great music. Not only country music, but rock and roll as well. And folks who visited California often stopped by the town's honky-tonks just to hear the music. I played guitar as much as I could in various Bakersfield joints and sang as much as they'd make me. Smiling Jack Tyree. Jack called me from Springfield and told me that he'd give me a job, $50 a week, playing guitar and singing on his radio show. Now, I'd never been any farther east than the trip to Texas. He said he'd send me the fare for a bus ticket to Springfield, Missouri, to be part of his show. So I took him up on it. 18 years old, here I go. My first real paying job. Now, I'd never worked that far east before, and I hated the trip. And I soon hated my stay, so I didn't stay too long. I quit after three weeks as a featured singer and guitarist. I was homesick for Bakersfield and for money. After 21 days, I was frowning because smiling Jack Tyree hadn't paid me a dime. I marched into Jack's office to give him my resignation and collect my money. Jack had agreed to pay me $50 a week. He owed me $150. I asked him for it, and he said, I'd like to pay you, but I just don't have the money right now. To this day, I haven't figured out why some promoters and others think that paying a musician is optional. They think it's necessary to pay the doctor and their electric bill, but a musician? Hey, let him wait for his money or stiff him. Today, Fuzzy Owen, my personal manager, collects my money. We don't even drive to the date unless we've been paid half the fee in advance. Once we arrive, the promoter often wants us to do the show, saying he can pay us after he's counted the receipts. Sometimes an argument follows. We played Colorado City, Colorado in October 1998, and we were supposed to be paid a percentage of every ticket that was sold. Fine. Then Fuzzy noticed that the promoter had put at least 300 folding chairs in front of the people who had paid for front row seats. The front row people were pissed because they couldn't see, and I was unhappy because the promoter tried to stiff me out of money from seats he wasn't even supposed to sell. Fuzzy bugged him throughout the program and we eventually got our money. I've had 41 number one records and played for U.S. presidents. And I still have to fight occasionally to get my performance fee. And I think most musicians do. There isn't a singer in the entire country music industry who can't tell story after story about all the outrageous things he had to go through, including fistfights, gunplay, just to get money owed to him. I can't pay you. Smiling Jack continued that day in Springfield. Old Smiling Jack Tyree is broke. I ain't got no money. I was more than 1,500 miles from home, broke, and had no funds to get home. I don't remember how I discovered the location of Smiling Jack's petty cash, but I walked to his desk. Then I raised his trouser leg and pulled the water bills from his sock. I should have taken it all. Instead, I counted out $150. and threw the remainder on his desk. He said, I'll have you arrested before you get to the city limits. And I said, go right ahead, mister. I rode a Greyhound to Bakersfield, not knowing what my future held and certainly not knowing that one day I'd climb aboard a bus and still be riding in 1999. In 1956, I had to get back to Bakersfield. I'd married a woman there two years earlier when I was only 17. Nadine and I were dragging Main Street. That's what we called it in the 1950s. That meant we were cruising Main Street while looking at the girls between stopping for Cokes or sneaking into the back of a beer joint. I was 17 and driving a car that I'd bought with a down payment and my mom's co-signature. Leona Hobbs and her sister Alice were 15 and 13, respectively. They didn't look it, especially Alice, who was fully developed, I imagine, by the time she was 12. I wouldn't have thought those girls were sisters because they didn't look alike. When they told me they were sisters, I thought they were lying. Alice looked like Laura McCall, and Leona was a gorgeous lady when she was young, but Alice was beautiful. First time I met the sisters, I went for Alice. I asked the girls, I said, hey, would you like to have a hamburger? and said, yeah, I'd like to have two. I don't know if I got enough money for everybody to have two hamburgers. Are you the only one that wants two? We got into a little tiff right there. Leon and I hit it off because we were so wrong for each other. The challenge was on both sides of the road, you know? She wasn't one to walk away from a challenge, and I wasn't either. We started arguing right from the beginning, and we argued right up until the time that we saw each other leave. The most recent time I spoke to her, and here I am in my 60s, she said she hated me. Leona and I eventually moved in with my brother Lowell and his wife. Couples live together freely today, but in 1956, couples who shacked up were looked down upon, at least by my family. I didn't care what anybody thought about me, and I know that Leona didn't care what anybody thought about her. With all of my confinements and all the times I'd run away since my dad had died nine years ago, I figured that I owed my mom no more pain. If it hadn't been for Mama's shame, I might never have married Leona Hobbs. I didn't really propose to Leona. I just mentioned to Lowell that it might be a good idea if Leona and I got married. She happened to be standing there when I said it. She was, in fact, overhearing a conversation about her, not one directed to her. I asked Lola, I said, can you take me and Leona to Reno, where we can get a quick wedding, the way you can do even today in Nevada? There's a place in Las Vegas today that is a drive-through wedding chapel. You can drive through and order a marriage license and be pronounced man and wife without even getting out of your car. Our wedding wasn't quite that easy, but almost. Lowell and his wife Fran drove us to Reno and were our witnesses in a tiny chapel. We were man and wife, or should I say, man and war. I worked in the cotton fields, and I shared what I made with Leona's 11 brothers and sisters and her father and mother. I worked in the oil fields, too, and music was something we did when we had the time. The great Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys came to an end in 1949 when Tommy Duncan left and went on his own. Tommy Duncan, the former lead singer for Bob Wills, was playing in Hanford, California in 1956. Will Ray put together a band and called and asked me if I'd like to play lead guitar. Being asked to play behind this legend and one of my true idols remains one of my greatest professional thrills to this day. Since that time, I've met presidents, three or four of them. I met John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart, but nothing was like the thrill of meeting Tommy Duncan. There was about 13 musicians in this band that Will Ray had thrown together. There was, like, accordion players and eight-string mandolin players and things that just did not work for a swing band. And I felt so sorry for Tommy. I don't think Tommy knew any of them. And after he'd finished Deep Water, he walked over to me and he said, well, sort of low, he said, it looks like we've got it to ourselves. Would you mind sort of kicking these songs off for me? His demeanor and the way he complimented me in that request inspires me even today. If my career had stopped right there, I think I would have wound up with an eternal lump in my throat. Leon Copeland, his wife Mildred, Leona, and myself went to play music with Tommy Duncan. Leon and I had been married about a year. We rode to the dance in Leon's 1951 Ford. Funny what details he remembered. After having seen Tommy with Wills, such an outstanding band like the Texas Playboys, it was a heartbreaker to see him with the likes of what we played with that night in Hanford. I know old Will Ray did his best, but the mandolin players and too many guitarists and everybody playing the same thing, no bass, no drummer, and of course no brass and no fiddles, it just wasn't good enough for Tommy. To top it off, Tommy was playing a big room that was capable of probably holding about 1,500, maybe 2,000 people. And all that was present was about 75, maybe 100 in the audience. The sight really depressed me. Tommy deserved a whole lot more than to have to sing with all those bad players. So I was distant and thoughtful as I drove Leon's car home that night. I don't know why he didn't drive. Perhaps he was too drunk. Leona, sitting in front next to me, noticed my silence. If a woman isn't in the mood to make love, a man is wasting his time, no matter what he tries. She might let him, but she won't enjoy it. And he'll be able to tell. In the same way, when a man doesn't want to talk, he doesn't want to talk. No amount of probing from a woman is going to make it happen. I wanted to be left alone, because I was quite disturbed over the lack of crowd that Tommy was able to draw. And Leona wouldn't hush. What's the matter with you? Why don't you talk? Well, I'm just sort of going over the evening, and I'm let down that Tommy didn't have no more people than he did. She said, well, if the son of a bitch could sing, he'd had a bigger crowd. Her words made me furious, and it cut me deeply. I don't advocate domestic violence, but that night in 1956, without even looking up from the highway, I drew back to backhand her, and she reached for the handle of the car door, opened it, and leaped out at 50 miles an hour. When I saw her bouncing like a rubber ball, I figured it was all over. Till that point, I was convinced that there was nothing this woman could do to amaze me. But that night, she did. I stopped the car and ran back to where she was. I was trying to check her for broken bones, but I couldn't hold her still because she was jumping around the highway, waving the skirt of her dress that she claimed I had torn because she had jumped out of the car. Leona was a mystery. Maybe that was the attraction. Maybe I just wanted to see what made somebody behave the way she did. Who knows what made me love her, but I did. We're all creatures of habit, and I was no exception. In 1957, I was 20 years old, and I'd first run away from home 10 years earlier. In other words, before two decades could pass in my life, I had spent half of it running away or behind bars or in one. I'm convinced I would have been a habitual criminal and would have had a short career. I would have gotten a life sentence early in life and probably died young if music and the good Lord hadn't saved me. Before my daughter Dana turned one and I turned 21, I was back behind bars. I really thought I was doing the right thing. I had rented a trailer and had a couple of guys hired, and was in the process of buying junk, finding junk, and selling junk. I'd go down into the hills of Bakersfield and was looking for things that people had thrown away. And we found this deposit of scrap iron, including motor blocks and frames and things of that nature, and we were in the process of loading them up and taking them to the junkyard and selling them. and we'd been there for three days in the sunlight, daytime, doing this, when all of a sudden the highway patrol showed up on top of the hill. They zoomed down on us, threw down on us with guns, and me and Claude Reed, and I forget the other boy's name, put our hands up. What's the matter? You guys are stealing this man's stuff. I looked at the man and I said, well, I'm sorry. I said, I didn't know you owned this. I said, I'll go get the stuff and bring it back. And he said, you knew it. I've been watching you for a year out here. And I said, pardon me? I said, I've been here for three days. And I said, we've been working real hard and trying to stay out of trouble. I said, does it look like we're trying to steal something out here in the middle of the day? And I said, you got no fences? You got no signs? And the police officer stopped and looked at the man and said, that's right. You don't have any fences and you don't have any signs. How would anybody know you wanted this stuff? And the man's reply was, I don't have to have any fences, and I don't have to have any signs. That stuff belongs to me, and I want these boys arrested.\" And the man was right, I guess. And the cop said, well, we got no alternative, boys. You're going to jail. And we did, and they sent us to three months in road camp. I served five days. This time, I wasn't released for good behavior. No one had time to evaluate my behavior. I escaped. It took God seven days to make heaven and earth. It took my guard five days to take his eyes off me. And it took just a few seconds to escape. And I faded into the landscape, and then I ran like hell. I'd planned to escape, and now that I was on the lam, I realized that I hadn't planned where to go. I knew I couldn't go home. I knew the cops would expect me to go straight to my wife and baby. So I went north to Utah. I was guilty of escaping from jail and abandoning my new baby. I was born the running kind, with leaving always on my mind. I wrote those lyrics in minutes. I spent years living them. I still can't believe the man who today occupies my body is the person that I used to be. Things didn't work out in Utah. I came back through Bakersfield and caught a ride with a man who was a Jehovah Witness. And he was on his way to working the sawmills up north, and I thought, boy, that's just the place for me. He gave me a ride because I could drive. I was 18 years old, and he had a family, and he needed some help. I was the right guy, and he was a nice man. I went to Eureka, or rather Arcata, California, right next to Eureka, and got a job in a plywood mill. I worked there for six weeks before they found me. Somebody snitched me off. They came in with handcuffs right in front of the rest of the workers and arrested me, and they all stood there with their mouths open wondering what I'd done. Back to Bakersfield County Jail. I got an early out on that conviction. because my mother came and begged the sheriff to let me out early because I had a job. I hadn't been out of jail very long when Leona announced that she was pregnant again. Life with her was unsettling. That's the most polite way I can find to say that I was miserable. I wasn't ready for marriage, much less fatherhood, then more fatherhood. I heard about an oil boom in New Mexico, and I knew they'd be hiring hands. My old friends Bob Tigg and Dean Holloway and I agreed that we should go and try to get us a job. Geology wasn't as sophisticated then, and no one knew how long an oil boom would last. So Dean, Bob, and I took off for New Mexico, and I told Leona I'd send her some money for the babies just as soon as I made some, and told her there were no way I could make any money in Bakersfield. She got mad, of course, but I think she secretly understood that with my reputation and work history, there was not exactly a surplus of employers who wanted to hire me in my hometown. Now I had a new problem. I needed some seed money to get to New Mexico so I could make some money to send to my family, and I needed it quickly. Desperate men do desperate things, and they do familiar things. So I lifted the money to get out of town. About three months earlier, I'd been fired from a Shell gasoline station for something I didn't do. It was unfair. And I still owned a Shell service station uniform. And I knew that everything was secured. The entire place was secured by one lock, one big padlock. So I went down to the hardware store, and I bought a padlock. just like the one I used to lock up every night. And I went down to the station, bought some gas, and while the old boy was filling me up, I went around to where the padlock goes on, and I took his off and put mine on. I kept his, and that night, at ten o'clock, when everything closed, I showed up at ten minutes after ten, unlocked my lock, went inside, and while I was in there, the door shaker came by, and he saw me, and I waved at him. He waved at me, and I reached into the safe that they left open, because it was only about $150 in there that they left for the business. I took that money, went back out, and locked his lock back on, taking my lock with me. The next morning, when they came in, they fired the guy who had lied about me. Dean had a brand new 57 Pontiac because he'd been working in the oil fields, and all we needed was the money to get to New Mexico. The $150 would work fine. When we got to New Mexico, the oil field was still producing, but there were thousands of people there waiting for jobs. They had all been filled. Bob was lucky enough to land a job driving taxi. Dean and I rode around with him because it was snowing and the mud was thick. There were no blacktop streets. And it was rough, to say the least. Bob and Dean Rowe finally wound up going to Texas, and I came back to California, because I hated the cold weather. We split what little money we had three ways. I think my part was $12. I bought a ticket as far as I could go, which was Flagstaff, Arizona. I wound up there with less than a few cents in my pocket. I hitchhiked towards California, which was picked up by a man driving a load of Christmas trees, and later by four drunken Indians. I could feel a familiar sense of hostility that might have left me dead in the desert. When I got in the car, there's four drunk Indians in the front seat. It's not big enough for four drunk Indians. I couldn't turn the ride down. They'd have whipped my ass and killed me. So I got in the car with them, and they said, sing something. They'd never seen me before in my life. And said, sing something. And I said, OK. Always late. I sang that. I sang it all the way through. And they'd stop drinking their whiskey, and they looked at me, and their mouths fell open. They said, sing it again. And I sang it again. And for 65 miles, I sang always late. A few things come to mind about that ride with the man in the Christmas tree. To back up a bit, there was a big hole in the floorboard. And we were at 7,000 feet. My Levi's were already froze when I got in the truck. And I thought, boy, I'm going to get some warm, restful sleep. But sure enough, I was wrong. And that wind, from all the way from Flagstaff, all the way down to the Colorado River in Needles, California, where it finally got warm, that hole supplied cold air. I later hopped a freight train in Needles, California, later that same day, about five in the evening. I estimated the time between Needles and Barstow to be somewhere around three or four hours. Boy, was I off. I think I arrived in Barstow about three in the morning. That was where I gave up the hobo life and called my mama. There was no point in calling Leona, because I knew she didn't have any money. I hadn't sent her any, but then I hadn't earned any. All I had was what little I stole, and it didn't last very long. If We Make It Through December was the number one song for me. Lasted four weeks in the top position in 1973. It's about a man who loses his job in a factory, and he's broke, and he wants Christmas to be the happy time of the year for his little girl. Funny, the song was inspired by Roy Nichols. He used to get a divorce every December. One day I asked him, I said, how's your marriage doing? His reply, well, it'll be fine if we just make it through December. That's all I needed. Dana was one year old and my second child, Marty, hadn't been born. Having a baby and another one on the way should have made a happy holiday spirit. But there's no joy in poverty at any time of the year. One night shortly before Christmas, a friend named Mickey came by to visit with Leon and me. We had enough money to feed all of us and the baby and for Mickey and me to get drunk on cheap wine. Really drunk and really cheap. We talked about the frustration of our situations and the hopelessness of an honest man trying to make an honest living and doing honest work. It was especially outrageous to think that two dishonest men could have such a conversation. I think I was the first to suggest burglary. I told Mickey about Fred and Gene's, a restaurant owned by Dean Rowe's uncle. It had come to that I was planning to rob the relative of one of my best friends, probably my very best friend. Mickey and I, by then, had probably drunk four or five bottles of that cheap stuff. Stumbling around, I told Leona to pack up the baby. Mickey and I were tired of being poor. I took my pregnant wife and a one-year-old baby into the December night with my drunken friend to rob a restaurant. I thought I'd waited long enough for the beer joint-restaurant combination to be closed by now. Time flies when you're having fun. That's another old saying I've found to be true. Time drags when you're worried, and it must have been dragging for me. Time was not the wee hours of the morning, as I thought. It was 10 p.m. I was seconds away from breaking into the back door of a restaurant that was open for business. Drunks don't realize how noisy they are. I was probably less than quiet as I removed the screen door with the crowbar. When I had difficulty, I simply tore the door from its hinges. Probably sounded like an explosion inside the cafe. With the crowbar, I began to pry at the backside of the door. I should have just opened it. It wasn't locked. I discovered that when the owner opened it, and recognized me. Gene said, why don't you boys come around the front? Come in like everybody else. Dammit, I was trying to rob the man secretly, and he was being kind and inviting me to come in. I took off like Jesse Owens. The owner stood bewildered as we ran to our car and burned rubber to get away. I wonder what he said when he called the police, probably something like this. You know, you're not going to believe this, but Merle Haggard just tried to break into my restaurant, which is wide open for business. Isn't that funny? We were speeding away in the dark with our lights out. Less than half a block away from the restaurant, a highway patrolman came around the corner, seen us with our lights out, whipped in behind us and flipped on his red light. He knew that we were the guys that made him his living. Burglary wasn't something new for me. I had managed to come by a check protector from a place called Russ Taylor's Fire Prevention. I had it between my legs, and when the cops stopped us, there it was, one of the first things they saw. So they knew they had somebody that was planning to do something, or had just done something, or maybe both. And they were right in both cases. Leona and the baby were wrapped in blankets in the back seat. I looked at them as I saw the cops approaching our stopped vehicle. I saw fear in her face and guns in their hands. I had gone out to get enough money to finance our Christmas. Now, not only would money be missing at Christmas, so would I. Our car, with their lights on, made a dark getaway area in front of my car. The police had Mickey in back of my car, and we were ordered to sit in the back seat. And then I said, I got to run, baby. Here's my chance. She understood. I assured her cops wouldn't hurt a pregnant woman with a baby. I pulled off my boots and silently rolled out the door. I hit the ground in my sock feet. I got to the railroad track just a few feet away and up over the fence into the railroad track and was gone. But the remainder of the night was all I was allowed to stay free. I went straight to my mother-in-law's house and they knew that's where I'd go and they showed up there, arrested me, and I was once again back in jail. As I was being booked by the sergeant, fingerprinted and whatever, a few of the cops passing by called me by name, and I did the same with them. Sergeant Matlock put his hand in the small of my back and began to escort me down the hall to what was known as the hole. I'll never forget that Christmas. I spent it without any clothes on, and I spent the entire night praying and beating the side of the bunk, saying I wish I had just 24 hours to say goodbye to the ones I love because I knew this time I wouldn't be coming home soon. The next day, a parole officer who had been in charge of me all throughout my California Youth Authority escapades came in to say how sorry he was that I was being turned over to the adult authority knowing the charges, he knew that I was headed for big time. What a wonderful man. He was a large, red-headed man. I forget his name. But he said goodbye, and he turned me back over to the same sergeant, Sergeant Madlock. And Sergeant Madlock, once again, put the palm of his hand on my back, but this time he led me to a different door. He said nothing, and the other cops didn't say anything either. It was almost as if they wanted me to run. I had embarrassed law enforcement statewide. Maybe they were looking for an excuse to put a permanent stop to the embarrassment. Maybe they were trying to set me up on a repeated offender charge for my multiple escapes. Maybe they even wanted to gun me down. I'll never know. The sergeant walked me to the front door, the main door, the one that goes to freedom. Then I realized the only footsteps I heard were my own. Had he dropped back a few steps? I didn't look around. I was looking at the clear blue sky in front of me. I just kept walking, gradually bent my path. I walked out of the front door of the Bakersfield County Jail in broad daylight. I could lie to you and tell you some story out of a Zorro film about leaping from top of a building to another top of a building or something. until I found my freedom. But I did what I'd done before. I just faded into the wall. That's about the best way I can explain my talent for escape. I guess I envisioned myself fading into my surroundings. And that's exactly what I often did. I did it again on December 24, 1957, as I slipped through the crowded hallway full of police officers who knew me by my first name and right out the front door of the Bakersfield County Jail. What happened next, for many years, I would look back and attribute to the answer of a prayer, that same prayer that I beat on the cell door with that night while I was naked. I had prayed for 24 hours on the streets to say goodbye to the people that I loved so much. I made my way to where Leon Copeland was painting cars for a living at Barber Pontiac in Bakersfield. Mr. Barber, the owner of the place, recognized me and said, you know what? They're broadcasting your picture on the television. And I said, really? What are they saying? He said, something about dead or alive. And Leon says, let me get him out here, sir. Well, Leon took me out to a place called the Lame Duck Motel. And I told Leon, I said, if you can find Leona, go get her, bring the babies, and bring them here. And he did. He brought them out to that old hotel or motel. And we spent some time together and said goodbye. She went on back to her mother's house. And I called my cousin, Lomer. And I said, uh, is there any way that you can come get me and take me in a car somewhere where I can get to a freight train or something? Because I was without a car. I was on foot. I knew I couldn't walk. They'd pick me up for sure. They'd see me. Once again, it's still Christmas Eve. I've been in jail. I've been arrested by a man named Tommy Overstreet. thrown in jail, and walked out, and they've put this dead or alive arrest deal on my head, and to get away was all I could think about. But I had to say goodbye to my brother Lowell and his wife, and I figured before I left, so there I was on my way to Lowell's against Lomer's wishes. He dropped me off there in less than an hour. It was getting dark, and I saw some flashlights outside, and I said, Lowell, they're here. I don't guess there's any way I can get away, so just let them come on in.\" Pretty soon they began to knock on both doors. Lo and behold, in the front door came Tommy Overstreet, the very same police officer who had arrested me the night before. I said, Tommy, I've escaped twice in the last 24 hours, and I don't think there's much chance of doing it again. I said, would you mind before you put those handcuffs on me if I had a big shot of this old granddad? He said, Merle, I don't think it'd be out of line at all. He said, in fact, I think I'd like to have a shot myself. And I turned that whiskey up. I think I drank half of it. And I said, boys, I think I'm ready. They handcuffed me and took me to jail. And this time they looked up my ass and made sure I didn't have anything. I guess they thought I had a hacksaw up there. But anyway, I got away with $100. and went to isolation. And I spent Christmas in 1957 naked in Bakersfield County Jail. Those were the least of my problems. I was sent to Chino Guidance Center, where I would subsequently undergo formal sentencing. What I mean is that Chino was a place where they held you and analyzed you until they knew something about you and knew where you might fit in. Of course, being a young, innocent boy, I figured that they'd probably send me to some minimum security place, you know. I didn't have to worry about places like Folsom or San Quentin or anything like that. And I thought, you know, my next in line would be probably Tracy, would be right after Preston. That's probably me being 20 years old. Yeah, they'll send me to Tracy. And, you know, they'll find out that I'm not crazy. And they evaluated me. And we went through that period of time. And it's something like boot camp. And I remember that there was a great song written by a prisoner there while I was there. I can't remember the guy's name, but he wrote Unchained Melody while I was in that particular place. I didn't realize just how tired the state of California was of Merle Haggard. Maybe I was having fun, but they weren't. I understood the procedure from watching the other convicts get their assignments. I knew that it came on a little thin onion skin, different kind of paper than I'd ever seen before. I don't know where they got that paper. It was different. But you could see through it, and they brought it to you in the wee hours of the morning, something like 3.30, usually while you were asleep. But I imagine that I wasn't the first convict to probably spend the whole night awake waiting on that little onion skin piece of paper. And every time that the keys would move at the other end of the block, you know, you'd jar awake, and you'd say, oh boy, here it comes. Here comes the orders for the rest of my life. Or, you know, what are they going to do with me? It's going to be here in a minute. And then, sure enough, it wouldn't be you. You know, something else would have happened. And that goes on all night long. And finally, when this man walks up and places this little piece of paper in this clothespin, that they put on the bar to replace your mail and that sort of thing. And that's where they put that little paper. And I laid in bed after they walked by. I thought, you know, you ought to get up and see what it says. And I thought, I'm afraid. And I got up and I walked over to the bars. And the light was just so that it was dark in my cell and there was light outside. So it came through the paper. And I looked up and I seen this, I thought it said sand. I said, what is that? And I jerked the sucker down and held it up to the light, and it said San Quentin. And I think if there was ever a period in my life in which I grew up, I think it was that moment. Today, as you drive through California, you see several prisons. They're not an unusual sight. Back then, there were five famous prisons in the nation. Folsom, Alcatraz, Sing Sing, Joliet, and San Quentin. No matter which one you were in, you'd rather be in the other one. It was just beginning to get dark as the bus pulled up after a 500-mile trip. We looked up at this enormous penitentiary, with lights and armed guards, and the place spread everywhere. and I couldn't see it all from inside the bus. It was about 10.30 at night when we finally got inside. I didn't know one block from another. I found out later that they brought us through the north block and across the big yard and underneath the canopy. In the east block, on the left, some of the guys were still awake. I could see them staring from the windows and from their different tears. Such a sight I'd never seen before in my life. Some of them screamed fish. Some of them whistled. And I thought, oh, shit. What have I got myself into this time? I mustered in, and I was taken to my first cell, 4B13 in the South Block. 500 men were housed inside a cell house with 250 cells, that were smaller, maybe half as small as those found in the county jail. I'd never seen cells so small. When I finally got into the cell, I remember thinking, they've got me. This time, they've really got me. The cell was the width of a bunk, plus the span of my shoulders. This was for the toilet and the sink. It must have been maybe nine by five, no more. This particular night in San Quentin, the arrival, the walk through the yard, and being placed in my cell, if I have some way underplayed it, let me impress upon you, it was the scariest moment of my life. The moment seemed to last forever. It lasted till I finally went to sleep. Yeah, the trip to San Quentin was every bit as frightening as you might imagine. All I could hope for was that one of them big son-of-a-bitches didn't want to make a girl out of me. And all I could hope was that I had the courage to stand up for myself and not let it happen. Because San Quentin was the place where they sent the biggest and the toughest men in California, the eighth largest government in the world. I guess I tried to be invisible, slip through the cracks. In prison, you do your own time. You don't infringe on other people's personal lives, or ask questions, or borrow candy or cigarettes. You never know what else might be going on in a person's life. For example, some guy may have just found out that his boy on the outside is dying of cancer, or something just as bad. You say something to that guy, and he's liable to kill you before he realizes. I made friends with a lot of people in San Quentin. I don't think I had any enemies. But I couldn't play in the prison band for two years because I was on what they call close custody, thanks to my escape record. That meant that I was locked up after four o'clock each day. Finally, I was reclassified down to a medium security, which meant that I could play in the warden's band and play on the warden's show once a week, which happened every Wednesday. A lot of people ask me if I got anything beneficial out of San Quentin. Let me say, San Quentin was beneficial to me just as much as the Army was to a soldier. I was 20, full of piss and vinegar, with no intention of doing anything right. If there's a divine intervention, God intervened in my life and threw me in prison for a while. I think just to slow me down, maybe get my attention. A time or two I lay in my bunk and I could hear men crying out in pain from being raped by other inmates. I heard them beg for mercy. After a short while, I wasn't afraid at San Quentin anymore. I guess you could say that I was institutionalized, some way calloused. I'd gotten used to this place quicker than I thought that I would. I was delighted to find that a man could get almost anything he had the money to buy. Inmates could buy dope, whiskey, marijuana, beer. Most all of the guards were on the take. Guards could be paid to look the other way also if someone's ass needed to be kicked. I'm sure guards and inmates both witnessed murders. The investigations were often a farce. When questioned, nobody ever saw a thing. That was the code. It's not smart to try bullshit in the joint. You better tell it like it is. If you make a commitment, you better keep it. Men die in San Quentin for not paying back a pack of cigarettes. I learned the prisoner's unwritten code very quickly. No one ever told me how much time I'd receive in the sentencing. Imagine living in this hell and not knowing when you were going to be getting out. That was clearly a violation of my civil rights. But I hadn't even heard of civil rights in 1958. I didn't know what they were. I didn't go to school, remember? The food was sometimes terrible, sometimes it was bad, sometimes it was all right. But it was not best to complain. I had five jobs at San Quentin, and I think I was fired from every one of them. Eventually, I did my best work by doing nothing at all. My true talent took a lot of thought, because it was escaping. But I tried not to fantasize about it in San Quentin. I didn't know exactly how much time I had to go, But I knew I didn't get life, and I knew I was young enough to start over after I'd served my time. I didn't want to blow it by escaping, getting caught and seeing another 15 years or maybe a life tag added to my sentence. Any chance for parole would be denied after such a try. One of the bad jobs I had in San Quentin was working in the prison laundry. It was sort of dirty. Socks were sweaty, and the men sometimes didn't bathe. I developed a fungus from handling the filthy clothes. First it began to eat at my skin. Soon it was eating right through my own fingernails. Do you know how sensitive the skin is underneath your fingernails? I spent a lot of time at the prison hospital trying to decide what to do about this newfound problem in my fingers. One inmate suggested that I try pissing on my fingers. Hard to do. I was trying. I was really trying to adjust to the hell that they call prison life. You know, it was like a city with no women. And it really wasn't all that tough. If you were tough, there was somebody there to take care of you. There was a team called the Goon Squad that consisted of four or maybe six men that always took care of the tough guys. I made sure that I wasn't one of those. My cellmate, for the sake of this story, was named Sam. He worked in the furniture factory with a man named Jimi Hendrix, whose nickname was Rabbit. Nicknames were common in the joint. A bank robber was doing two five-to-life sentences running end-on-end, non-concurrently. If sentences ran concurrently, no matter how many you had, they all counted as one. So this guy was doing at least 10 years and probably more before he came up for parole, which would likely be denied. Sam and Rabbit planned an escape. And because of my reputation, and because of the fact that Sam wasn't interested in going, Sam let me in on the plan. My escaping would make San Quentin look foolish. It would mean the place couldn't even hold a little guy from Oildale. But in my mind, I knew all the time that I was never gonna escape with Rabbit or anyone else. I didn't have enough time. But I gotta say that Sam and Rabbit came up with a really good scheme. Sam McCartner was helping to build a desk that would be shipped to the judge, and the plan was to pack rabbit inside. No guard was dumb enough to tear into a desk that was custom made for a judge. The judge might want to know who had messed with his furniture, and the guard might be out of a job. I had many reasons for not going, because we'd be the first escapees to clear the walls in 13 years, and we'd be the subject of a nationwide manhunt. Someone was sure to be killed. The warden and the governor and the judges would all see to that. There's no way that they'd have the corrections department embarrassed in front of the whole world. So Rabbit vowed that once he got beyond the walls that he'd do anything, anything, to keep from coming back. And I knew what he meant. I knew he liked me enough that he didn't want to see me caught in the crossfire. Rabbit reminded me in front of Sam that I was only 20 years old, young enough to start over with my life. He stressed that if I behaved, I could get out before too long. On the other hand, he'd be at least 40 before he got out. Who'd hire a 40-year-old man with penitentiary listed on his resume? Rabbit had less to lose than I did. He told Sam that I was welcome to come with him, but he advised me to stay. As I said, his advice was unnecessary. I saw Sam at lunchtime, and he told me that the plan had gone smoothly. The rest of the day, I was uptight, wondering what was going on, wondering if he'd made it. But I wouldn't know until that evening. By 4 p.m., everybody in the joint knew something was wrong. And nobody had said a thing. At last, the whispers started. The body count's wrong. It had been 13 years since the successful escape from San Quentin inside the walls. And the men hated the delay of supper, which occurred when the count was wrong. All of us used to hate that. And for 13 years, whenever the count had been wrong, it had been because the guards were too stupid to perform basic arithmetic. And now everybody was laughing again, because they could imagine the warden chewing out these guards over the false alarm. That's what each of 6,000 men, almost to the man, thought. But Sam and I knew differently. The count was right. A man was missing. They didn't let us eat that night till maybe 7.30, maybe even as late as 8 o'clock. They held us in the cells. By the time they fed us the fodder they called food, the mess hall was one big celebration. Rabbit had run. Rabbit's run, yelled a prisoner. But the noise of the mess hall was too loud, and not even the guards with the guns turned around. When we returned to our cells, we had little earphones with, I think, a selection of about five channels. and everybody tuned to the news channel to see how the manhunt was going. The newscaster said, Jimmy Hendricks has been identified as the first man to escape from the San Quentin walls in 13 years. The warden and prison officials are confused and bewildered as to how it occurred. The entire population exploded like thunder. There were broadcast updates about the missing prisoner every day for a week. Inmate morale had never been higher. It was as if we were factory workers supporting a hometown boy on the front lines during a war. One man had taken on the entire system, and he was winning. I knew he'd eventually lose, but I never said it out loud. Somebody might have thought I was taking the warden's side. Rabbit soon became old news. Newscasters stopped mentioning his name. Then one day a program was interrupted for a bulletin. A man thought to be Jimmy Hendricks had shot and killed a California highway patrolman, which stopped him for a routine violation. Patrolman had him surrounded in a hotel somewhere near San Jose. Sam and I both knew that he'd do anything to keep from coming back. He'd kill an innocent man doing his job. When the trooper had asked Rabbit for his driver's license, Rabbit had blown him away, point blank, with a shotgun. A .410 is the smallest caliber shotgun made. But at close range, a man can put his fist through the hole that it will make in a human chest. I truly pray for the man's family, and I hope that he died instantly so that he didn't suffer. And I'm sorry that I'm in any way involved. Maybe I'm not. Maybe I'm just the messenger. Rabbit returned to San Quentin for escaping and for first-degree murder. The state of California discontinued the electric chair by 1958. It had been replaced by cyanide. People ask me all the time about my excellent memory. I can talk about the night I swept the Country Music Association Awards. I can talk about performing for the U.S. presidents. But I have no memory more vivid than seeing Jimmy Rabbit Hendricks led to his death. One guard walked in front of him, another behind. They held 30-06 rifles, and he wore leg irons and chains. Now, that wasn't the way they marched him to the death room, or to the death cell. But that was the way they marched him across the yard, back and forth to his attorney. I am glad I didn't see the final walk. Was Rabbit wrong to kill the trooper? Of course. Was he wrong to escape? You tell me after you've done hard time. And you're looking at nothing else but more hard time. You tell me after you've done that. I didn't sleep the night before Rabbit's execution. Instead, I played out his execution in my mind. Three men. who wouldn't even look him in the eye, would each push a button. But no one would know which button actually dropped the sack of cyanide into the bucket. The fall would tear the sack, and the fumes would rise upward into the nostrils of Jimmy Rabbit Hendricks. When a man was executed at San Quentin, it took place usually at 10 o'clock in the morning. and a puff of smoke would be released from the stack above the north block the instant a condemned man died. The stack was in full view of the majority of 6,000 men who stood as silently as Rabbit sat. The smoke faded away, and so had a life. Rabbit would run no more. The warden led a prisoner down the hallway to his doom. I stood up to say goodbye like all the rest. I heard him tell the warden just before he reached my cell, let my guitar playing friend do my request. Those words are from Sing Me Back Home, my third number one song, released in 1967. They were partially inspired by Rabbit. I'd been in the joint for 18 months before I had my first parole hearing. I got the results, and they came the same way that I got my San Quentin sentencing. Someone put a note between the bars, and I stared at it and wondered what was in it. Finally, got the courage to go see. I wish I hadn't even gone before the board, but I had no choice. Maybe I should have told them that I liked being Lord of the State. then probably they'd let me go just to make me unhappy. I live day to day largely for the visitation privileges. Leona came to see me and brought the kids, Mama, she came, Lowell came, Lillian came, and a few others. It was hard to see Leona and not be able to touch her. Eventually, she stopped coming. Sometime after that, she stopped writing. I soon found out why. It seems my wife was going to be blessed with a third child. But there'd been no sexual visitation between Leona and me. She was pregnant with someone I hadn't met, and I wasn't entirely sure of her whereabouts. Someone once said that the worst sickness in the world is homesickness. Homesickness is especially painful when you don't know the location of your home. which in my case was my wife and my two children. Work was the best escape I knew, except maybe for alcohol, so I decided to combine them. I'd go to work making alcoholic drinks. Whiskey was out of the question. I didn't have the ingredients, and I hoped I didn't have the time to get the stuff to age. But I could make beer. All the ingredients were in the prison kitchen, including yeast. Needless to say, I didn't embark upon the venture, but the blessing of Warden Dixon. I would have liked to have made some beer for him. I think he would have liked it. Funny, I never thought about pissing in his beer. I made the brew from stolen ingredients and packaged it in used milk cartons. Selling the stuff earned me a whole lot more than $18 a month, the maximum pay San Quentin was offering. My customers walked around the prison yard freely drinking the beer out of milk cartons. Some got plastered in front of the guards. My homemade beer was a lot more stout than the store-bought variety, and it smelled stronger, too. Nobody snitched on me, and nobody got me busted. I did all that by myself. By staggering and falling into the pisser, I went into the toilet about one o'clock in the afternoon. There was a gable off the building inside the upper yard, just off to the right after coming up from the lower yard. There are steps on the right, and then there's a big restroom. It's a horrible place. Ten or fifteen men were usually out there straddling the toilet because they didn't want to sit down on the nasty things. What a sight. You had to get drunk to stand it. So I did, and I staggered over to the pisser, drunk. I've been drunk six or seven times in my adult life, but never that drunk. I couldn't hold things together. I dropped my cigarettes in the urinal, and then I went in to get them. I moved too fast, and soon I was headlong into the urinal. Everybody in the whole restroom laughed, and the guards heard the laughter, and then here they came. And there I was in the urinal. They threw down on me just like they'd throw down on someone in the street. Sure enough, it was the goon squad. Men who'd whip someone's ass just to stay and practice. That was the goon squad, not to be confused with inmates. I looked up from the urinal in my drunken state of mind and saw this man with a .30-06 pointed at me from the catwalk. Get up and get out of there, sprout-legged. The next thing I knew, the goon squad was on me. I don't think they whipped me, but I had the worst hangover I'd ever had in my life. I got seven days in solitary confinement because I was a drunk in the yard. I don't think they knew I'd been selling beer. There was no bed inside solitary. The Bible was the only thing in the room besides a cement slab where a bed should be. They laid a mattress on the slab. They jerked the mattress every morning at five o'clock and gave it back at nine in the evening. There were no windows, and in the daytime, I read the Bible. At night, I used it for a pillow. My first night, I had no clothes, except for the cotton pajama bottoms. I lay on my bare back. That's hard and cold in any climate, at any time of the year, especially on San Quentin, close to the bay. I was 21 years old. Through the air vent in the wall, I could hear Carroll Chessman, a convicted serial rapist who'd been on death row for more than 10 years, exhausting one appeal after another. His cell was next to mine. One day, I overheard Carroll Chessman, and he was saying that he'd gotten a life insurance policy in the mail, and that maybe someone had sent it to him as a joke. I talked to Carol six or seven times during my seven days in isolation. Mostly I tried to cheer him up. I was there simply suffering a hangover. I was a young fuck-up. I didn't feel like I was qualified to shine his shoes. And I was gonna get out in a few days, you know? I was very respectful to him. He never saw my face and I never saw his, but we kept talking through the air vent. I've read stories about how those seven days on the shelf were the turning point of my life. They weren't. Those seven days just dried me out a bit. I'd been living pretty high in the yard, getting away with making beer, and I'd had plenty of money. I was self-supporting. My mother didn't have to send me money. I used my own money to buy a Martin guitar with 15 cartons of cigarettes that I'd made from running a three-for-two operation, which was a loan company. I wasn't scheduled for another parole board hearing for a while. When I did appear before the panel, my drunkenness in the yard would hurt my chances for getting released. I had to do something to impress the board. I volunteered for the toughest job in the place, working inside the textile mill. I could do anything I made up my mind to do, and I had my mind made up to get out of San Quentin by way of the textile mill or any other legal route. I didn't know what life on the outside held for me, but I wanted to go see. By now it was spring of 1960, May 2nd to be exact. I know because that was the day I saw the smoke rise from the chimney for the second time. Carol Chessman died vowing that he didn't commit the crimes for which he was being executed. A man who's about to face his maker wants to confess his sins and seek forgiveness. He doesn't leave the world lying. Chessman wrote letters to various people before he was killed. He wrote none apologizing. Doesn't that tell you something? I recall last Sunday morning, a choir from off the street came in to sing a few old gospel songs. Those lines are from Sing Me Back Home, the song partially inspired by Rabbit before his execution. Chessman was also an inspiration. The night before Chessman's death, the prison fell quiet. The warden gave the order for Chessman's execution at 10.03 a.m. That afternoon, a dispatch came from the governor's office that would have given Chessman a stay of execution. By then, his body was probably already embalmed. Leona came to see me in 1960 after the birth of her third child. She wanted to know when I would be going before the pro board again. I just wanted to know when I'd get out. And finally, it was time for another hearing. I went before the same bloodless men who looked like they'd been embalmed while still breathing. And I could hear the paper rattle as they passed the evaluation among them. To my delight, it mentioned the great job that I'd been doing at the textile mill. They couldn't believe that I'd been working, and working at the hardest job in the joint, and working it so well. Of course, they had to play the game. They had to have their power trip. So they came with all the dumb questions about whether or not I wanted to get out, and what I'd do when I did, and if I'd be a good citizen. Later that day, as always, their decision was on the little onion skin paper placed on the bars. I'd gotten credit for time served. With my forthcoming parole, I'd be out in less than, let me count, 90 days. I was jubilant. I could see light at the end of the darkest tunnel I'd ever entered. But the hardest part of any race is the finish. There's where you have to sprint by pulling determination from deep within. I counted the days. I had fun calculating the hours. The night before I was discharged, I laid down, but it was fruitless. I couldn't sleep. I was too excited. A kid never squirmed more on Christmas Eve. There is so much time to talk and so little to talk about. except what you remember from the outside. So I knew each friend's background, inside and out. My last meal was the first time I'd seen a group of prisoners with a tear in their eye. I was gonna miss these guys, and I felt like they'd miss me, too. I told them that someday I'd come back as a recording artist and do a concert. You know what? Years later, I did. I even walked through San Quentin with Merv Griffin on one side and the late Eldon Chamlin on the other, with Lewis Talley, some of my band members, and I took them to my old cell. They couldn't believe how tiny and cramped it was, and neither could I. I don't know how you stood it, Lewis said. Neither do I, I replied. I walked out of San Quentin the day of my release wearing paper shoes, One by one, I passed through each gate. I stood before the looming bars, and a guard in a tower pressed a button that opened each one. I had heard the same sick groan of the electric opening when I'd come into the joint, and had nearly thrown up. Now, that groaning was music. I passed through the last gates, a free man. and I could resist the temptation no more. I think I screamed out loud, I'm free. I looked around and all I needed was Leona, but she was nowhere in sight. I'd played the scene a thousand times in my mind. During her last visit, she'd made me promise that we'd make the marriage work when I was released. She and the children were supposed to pick me up. I'd run into their waiting arms and we'd start the rest of our lives. All of that works in a Hollywood movie. It was non-existent that November day outside San Quentin. I walked slowly down the sidewalk looking for some sign of Leona and the family. There was none. I turned around and I looked back at the walls. I thought maybe somehow or another she'd been inside there waiting for me. One of the guards from the gun tower looked down and said, are you not going to leave? You're just going to hang around, huh? I said, well, I'm waiting for my wife. She's supposed to be here today to pick me up. He said, well, I haven't seen anybody this morning yet. I was standing, staring down the sidewalk, wondering what could possibly have happened. She'd promised to be here. All sorts of things went through my mind. I thought maybe she got drunk. Maybe somebody robbed her. Maybe she just couldn't be here. And about that time, a woman pulled to the curb in a luxury sedan. The woman was well-dressed and just looked rich, the way some folks do. Need a ride, she said. Huh? I said, you talking to me? Yes, sir. Bending down, I peered inside the car, which smelled of rich leather and sweet perfume. Would you like a ride somewhere? Maybe the bus station?\" How did she know? I thought, what is this? What's this all about? The woman told me right off that her intentions were honorable. She said she was transporting me because she did that every Tuesday when convicts are released. My husband and children don't know what I do. They'd have a fit. They'd be so worried. She said not one of the ex-convicts had harmed her and that each had been appreciative. She said she was very wealthy and that this was her way of giving back a little. So we rode, me in this ill-fitting suit and $15 in severance pay from San Quentin and her in this fancy car with fancy clothes. It all just didn't seem to fit. Once at the bus station, I bought my ticket. While waiting for the bus, I went across the street to a bar, walked in and ordered two double shots of vodka. They also had some package liquor there, and I bought a half a pint for the ride. As the bus pulled out of the station long after the woman had disappeared, I thought, I can't believe this really happened. I can't believe she did that. Was that a dream? Was it real? Maybe she was an angel. To this day, I've often wondered who she was. Headed home, riding a Greyhound bus through the valley that I love so much. So many changes. I didn't realize at the time that all the steam engines were gone, but I didn't notice any. And I saw that some of the camps where Leon and I'd lived were no longer there, such as Crown's Camp just north of Bakersfield, was gone. Although the scenery had changed, perhaps I'd changed more. Time, particularly time spent behind bars, transforms a man. Bakersfield. Good old Bakersfield. I was finally home. I had a wife and family there. Leona had failed to show up for my release from prison, claiming she'd had car trouble. I was sure that she, Leona, and my brother Lowell, and my brother-in-law Bill, and my sister Lil, and my mama would all be there as part of a welcoming party. If they'd wanted to see me as much as I wanted to see them, I think they would have been there. As I stepped off the bus, the entire party was not there. But my brother Lowell and his wife Fran and my Aunt Flora were there to greet me. And oh, how glad I was to see them. It was something to hold a woman close to you, even if she wasn't your woman. Lowell and Fran and Flora took me to Mama's, where I ate from her bountiful table. Everything was cooked just right. Not one dish contained floating rat shit. Being home was getting better by the hour. I didn't see Leona at first. It wouldn't have been hard for her to figure I'd be staying with either Mama or Lowell, but she didn't come to either place. It must have been the third day home before I located where Leona lived. It was quite some ways from where my brother's house was, so I asked to borrow his car. Of course, I didn't have a driver's license, and he knew it. He said, but I can't let you borrow the car with no license. You're just out of the joint. They'd catch you, they'd send you back, and me with you. So I walked about 15 miles, sure enough, in a little place called Rexland Acres, just south of Bakersfield. Leona was living there with my two children and the new son, Jamie. How could I have been judgmental about a child who'd had no say about when he was conceived or by whom? Let me say this, as truthfully as I've said anything in this audio book. I love my children, all six of them. I tried to love the seventh, and recently I've come to realize I love them more than I know. I forgive their transgressions against me, and I pray they forgive mine against them. I don't want to spend the future regretting the past. My children are welcome to be as much a part of my life as they want to. Speaking of children, Leona was pregnant again within days of my release. Condoms were expensive, and I've never liked them anyway. Leona may or may not have wanted me back as a husband, but she did need a breadwinner. Maybe that's why she decided to give the marriage another go. I went to work for Lowell, earning $80 a week digging ditches. $80 a week was a vast improvement over the $18 a month at San Quentin. And although I probably could have earned $80 or more with my beer concession, the prison officials had shut me down. Of course, I instantly began to hope for a job playing music. People talk about it's hard to find a job looking out your window, but that's exactly what happened to me. One was brought to my front door. A man walked up and knocked on my door. His name was Jack Collier. He introduced himself, and he said, we have a band, but we don't have no band leader, no front man. And I heard you're a front man and a singer. Is that true? I was somewhat set back with this, and I said, well, come on in. You say your name's Jack? Jack Collier. I said, Jack, I'll tell you what. I play guitar. And he said, what kind of guitar? And I said, well, I play a Fender. He said, no, I mean, what style? And I said, well, I do single string lead. What kind of guitar do you play, Jack? Are you a guitar player? Yeah. I do mostly Merle Travis stuff, Chad Ekins stuff. I said, man, that ought to work pretty good together. He said, are you a singer? I said, well, let me play you something. I had an old wire recorder there, and I turned it on. I just recorded a song called My Rough and Rowdy Ways. He listened to that, and he looked at me with apprehension and said, that's Lefty Frizzell. I said, no, it ain't. It's me. And so I sang the song for him again. He said, man, I think you're going to work great. I jumped at the chance, because I finally had a chance to do what I always wanted to do, or at least try, to make a living playing guitar. It wasn't long before I was playing in all the nightclubs in Bakersfield. It was so exciting to play in a band with the steel guitarist Fuzzy Owen, the guy from Tally Records who had indicated I sounded too much like some other people. I knew he was still a big shot at Talley, and I thought being around him could help change his mind. He could put me right next to Lewis Talley himself. Lewis was a big star in Bakersfield in 1960. He had his own local television show, he had his own restaurant called Lewis Talley's Cafe. He hosted a Saturday night dance over in Ridgecrest, and as I've said, he owned his own record label. Maybe what I've just said indicates that I had all this in my mind, that this was all a plan, but it wasn't that way at all. I was simply trying to make a living, add a few bucks and put a few beans on the table. I soon developed a following, playing these joints around Bakersfield. I think that's why Buck Owens called me. Buck was a big star, thanks to Under Your Spell Again, Above and Beyond, Excuse Me, I Think I've Got a Heart Egg, Act Naturally, and of course others. His biggest hits, such as Love's Gonna Live Here, My Heart Skips a Beat, Together Again, they were all yet to come. Unexpectedly, he called me one night at the blackboard while I was working and said, would you like to go on tour and replace a bass player for me? He said he quit at the last minute. I said, who is this? And he said, this is Buck Owens. I said, oh, I knew who it was. I'd be proud to go out with you, Buck. I'm not a bass player, but I'll try to do the best I can. You've got the job. I was earning maybe as much as $150 a week in my seven-day schedule. My work with Buck, which required me to drive an old camper that we'd borrowed from cousin Herb Henson, front the band, play bass, paid $75 a week. I found out after the fact, the way Buck figured it, it was worth $75 a week to me just to be working with him. While on that tour, which only lasted about two weeks, Buck came to the band and he said, boys, we got to name this band. Has anybody got any ideas what we should call the group? And I said, how about the Buckaroos? He said, that's perfect. I learned a lot of things, including what it was like to sing for maybe 17,000 people. We were playing Milwaukee Baseball Stadium with Buck when he broke a string and turned to me and said, saying something. I was only 18 months out of prison and green as a gourd. What do I do? I thought frantically. I'd done seven years in reform schools and finished out with a stay at San Quentin. But nothing was quite as frightening as facing that audience that night in Milwaukee. George Jones had recorded She Thinks I Still Care. It was currently number one in the nation. So that's what I did, unrehearsed. And would you believe I got a standing ovation? 17,000 people went to their feet for a kid from Bakersfield they'd never heard of before. I'd met George Jones earlier when I was playing at the Blackboard. He'd heard me singing and got drunk and wouldn't come on stage. He's been my biggest fan ever since. At least that's what he says. Somebody told me later that night, George said, who is that guy? Don Markham, my saxophone player of today, was working there at the Blackboard at the time. And he said, oh, that's some kid who just started to work here. That's the best singing I ever heard in my life, George said. I ain't going out there. That sounds like maybe it might be a made up story, but that actually happened. If you don't believe it, check with Don Markham and George Jones. When I got that standing ovation in Milwaukee, I feel sure that Buck was jealous, because he acted like it. He was the star, and he never got a standing ovation on the entire tour. After the show, Jim Reeves, the program's headliner, a giant star in America, approached me, and he said, I believe that's the best job of singing I've ever heard in my life, and stuck his hand out and shook my hand. Man, I love your voice. Little did I know that night that he would die in a plane crash later that year. My music career continued to progress in the early 1960s. I landed a job on Cousin Herb Henson's television show, and that's where I met Bonnie Owens, who would later become my wife, and would sing harmony for the next 30 years on my touring shows. 30 fuckin' years. Jesus Christ, and it still ain't over. By now, I was playing seven nights a week, and I was playing Cousin Herb's television show every day. Suddenly, people in Bakersfield didn't treat me like Merle Haggard, the truant, the escapee, or the ex-con, which I still was, and I was on parole. I confess I enjoyed the new status. No amount of money could ever lure me back to crime. Leona and I may have gotten along better during that period than any other. You can't fight with a woman if you don't see her. And all I did was work and sleep. There wasn't time for arguments. Of course, she complained about having to earn so many white shirts. But I was pumping more money into the household than we'd ever had. That made up for it, or at least some of it. When my daughter Kelly was born, it did little to improve the quality of my marriage life. Leon and I weren't fighting as much, but we weren't doing anything as much. It's been said that the opposite of love isn't hate, it's indifference. We were becoming more and more indifferent. One night as I was about to walk inside the Lucky Spot and start the shift, Dean Holloway pulled up in a brand new car as he always had in those days. Seemed like Dean always had a new car. And he said, hey, you know what? I'm going to Las Vegas to see Roy Nichols and Winn Stewart. You want to go? I said, hey, I can't go tonight. I got to work. Red Simpson, good old Red, was standing there. And he said, I'll fill in for you, Hag. Go ahead and go with Dean. I knew that Winn Stewart was playing in Las Vegas. And I wanted to hear him. He was hot property in those days with hits such as Wishful Thinking, Wrong Company, Big Big Love. Four or five hours later, we arrived in Las Vegas in front of the Nashville Nevada Club. What a club. When I walked through the swinging doors, the first thing I saw was Roy Nichols and that double-neck Mozart guitar that had a metal back on it and a picture of a man flipping a bird. He flipped it up and flipped me the bird and said, come get this son of a bitch and let me go take a leak. I thought to myself, I wonder if that's Ralph Mooney on the steel guitar. As I got closer, I could see it was. It was written on the front of the guitar. Me, sitting in with Ralph Mooney? Gosh, that must be... I guess that's Helen Price back there on the drums. All this was running through my mind. I insisted to Roy that, hey, look, I better not try this. He said, get the guitar, get up here and sing one. I'll be right back. I knew I sang better than I played, so I did a couple of three songs. On the last song, I noticed Winn Stewart standing in the middle of the dance floor with his arms crossed, looking at me. When I finished my set, Winn asked if I'd been working anywhere. I told him that I was working in Bakersfield with Lewis Talley and Fuzzy and all those boys and doing Cousin Herb's show. And Winn said, how about going to work for me? I said, well, I've already got those jobs there. He said, we'll pay you $225 a week to play bass in front of the band when I'm not here. I said, first of all, when I don't play bass well enough to play in this band. He said, we'll teach you. I said, well, what a great offer. What can I say? I'll try it. I'd always had a fondness for gambling. And it surfaced early on when I began playing in Las Vegas. I gambled away my pay and then some. The job was the best job I'd ever had, but the gambling just wasn't going to work. I had to quit Win Stewart and go back to Bakersfield, where there were no 21 tables. In those days, my work in a casino was as bad an idea as a drunk working a tavern. I earlier mentioned my whereabouts when some famous events occurred. I can also tell you exactly where I was and what I was doing the first time I heard my first record on the radio. I'd just gotten off work at the Blackboard Club, and I pulled into my driveway, which was only a couple blocks away, and it must have been around 3.30 in the morning. It's a big deal to me, because I was turning the dial, hoping to hear my song, when a man came on and said, Here's our pick of the week at KRAK in Sacramento. Merle Haggard would sing me a sad song. The song was the best thing that had come out of my brief time in Las Vegas. Winn Stewart, what a great guy. He'd written this song for himself to record on his next single, but he gave it to me. Some people ask me, why did Winn Stewart give you that song? I said, well, I got him in a squeeze play. I asked him one night just before we started to open the curtain, I said, when would you make me a star if it was within your power to do so? And he stopped and he looked at me and he said, why, of course I would. I said, well, you can. He said, how? I said, let me have sang me a sad song for my first release. He paused and he looked at the floor and he looked back at me and he said, you got me. You're going to have it. It was released three days after Christmas in 1963. It rose to number 19 on the Billboard survey. The record was by no means a monster, as it only appeared on the charts for three weeks, but I was a new artist. I was still happy with that. Playing an international venue like Las Vegas had done much to reduce my stage fright, but I couldn't stay because of the temptation to gamble. I'd often spent all of my earnings and all I could borrow One time I called mom and told her a lie that I'd been robbed. She wired me some money, then I gambled that away too. I remember Lewis Talley running my Keno card for me while I was playing 21. That meant that I had a hired hand running my Keno card for me. Time Magazine reported that I once lost $80,000 in a blackjack game. Truth is, I won $17,000 in that game and $85,000 playing Keno while Louie was running the ticket for me. We got the hell out of town quick. As my music began to catch on, I began to worry about my history as an ex-convict. How would my career be affected when folks found out that I'd been to the joint? And how would they find out? Would a reporter break the story? Would someone who I'd known in prison be sitting in the audience and tell everyone in the room? with a disc jockey, break my record on the air, and vow to never play another. Under the terms of my parole, I wasn't supposed to play in a bar, so I told bandleaders that I worked for not to call me by my name when they invited me to the microphone. There were lots of reasons to keep quiet about my past, but not lots of ways to do it. To my surprise, my parole officer gave me permission to leave the state, I think the California parole office saw that I had possibility. Or maybe California was glad to get rid of my trouble-making ass. In their way of thinking, they had pawned me off to Nevada. I'd done everything I could do to keep my past quiet. I was scheduled to do the Johnny Cash show. When we met John in June that day, we sat down to discuss the show. And John said, you know, Haggard, I know you've been to prison. June knows you've been to prison. And I think the best thing could ever happen to you would be if you'd let me tell the folks of America that you've been to the joint. I said, oh, Cash, I said, man, I don't want to do that. I said, I can't do that. I just don't. Man, that's the most embarrassing thing in my life. And he said, they're going to find out anyway. He said, if they find out in some tabloid, it's going to be bad on you. He said, let me tell them about you, how you had the courage to come forward. They say you can get away with anything except lying to a country fan. Well, George Jones proved that for years. He'd get drunk and miss a show. He'd schedule to make up the show, get drunk and miss that one too. But he never lied. He always told the fans that he was drunk, he was screwed up, He never told them that he was sick. And they appreciated that. Bob Wills did the same thing. Eldon Chamlin once told me a story. He said, if you told them that Bob was sick, they wanted their money back. But if you tell them that Bob was drunk out on the bus with a blonde, they'd dance away smiling. And so it was with me. When Johnny Cash told America where I'd been, things began to happen. Nobody was mistaking me for Elvis, but I'd made Billboard twice with two consecutive releases in 1963 and 1964. Did I mention that my fourth child was born about this time? I guess that shows where my priorities were. I regret daily that my music and career were often more important to me than my family in those early days. My current wife, Teresa, wouldn't believe that. I was 35 years old and much different in those days. Including Jamie, we had five youngsters at home in those early 1960s. We were a seven-member household, the head of which had one objective, to explode into the music scene. When you're trying to make it in the music business, you're always looking for a hit song. After you become established, the songwriters start looking for you. People want you to cut their tunes. I was playing a club in Sacramento one time when Lowell and Fran were living there. After that show, Lowell and Fran introduced me to someone they'd met during the show. Their name was Liz Anderson. Her husband's name was Casey. Liz wanted to cook breakfast for me, and I told Lowell, I said, really don't have time, you know, I need to go on. And he said, well, Bud, she says she has some songs, and, you know, she might have some good songs. In my mind, I didn't think there would be any good songs. I just figured maybe we could have some good breakfast. So I went with them out to their house. Right after breakfast, Liz got on this funny-looking pump organ and started playing these great songs. She played, My Friends Are Gonna Be Strangers first. Then she played, The Worst Is Yet to Come. Then she played, Our Hearts Are Holding Hands. Then she played, Just Between the Two of Us. I took three and said, I'll cut all three. Strangers released on January 2nd, 1965. It went to number four in the nation. It was the biggest hit I'd had so far. It inspired the name of my band, The Strangers. A couple of years later, Liz gave me another song called The Fugitive. We had to retitle it because of the popular television series at the time with David Jensen. So we called it I'm a Lonesome Fugitive. In 1998, Capitol Records released a box set of my work, recorded from 1964 until 1994. It was called Down Every Road, the first line from The Fugitive. Fugitive became my first signature song. Everyone will always associate Folsom Prison Blues with Johnny Cash and Devil Woman with Marty Robbins. and hopefully they'll always associate me with The Fugitive. I always perform it, and I always take pride in my first number one song. I was no longer the kid from Bakersfield. I was Merle Haggard. The disc jockeys, and more important, the fans, knew my name. One of the reasons I wanted to be a musician is so that I wouldn't have to get up early in the morning Nightlife was my way of life, just like it says in Willie's song. In the early 60s, Bonnie Owens was dating Fuzzy Owen. The three of us were infected with songwriting fever. I'd get an idea, and Bonnie would write it down. The words came just as fast as I could talk. Sometimes we'd miss words, and we'd never find them again. We later talked about how much fun it was during those innocent learning days, if you know what I mean. We'd created so much commotion with our three tally records that one day we got a call from Capitol, Capitol Records. Tim Nelson was on the phone wanting to know if we'd be interested in a Capitol contract. After all the many times we'd been down there, on the doorstep, begging for just that. It seemed sort of ironic they were calling us. After finishing a tour with Waylon Jennings and Bobby Bear and Hank Snow, Fuzzy and Bonnie picked me up at the Los Angeles International Airport at the end of the tour. We drove to Bakersfield. I couldn't wait to get to the house and see Leona and the kids. Our house May not have been a mansion by a lot of folks' standards, but compared with the little houses that men Leona had been living in, it was like Hearst Castle. Bonnie and Fuzzy waited at the curb to see if there was anyone home. My car wasn't in the driveway. The house was empty. Not only was it empty, it was a wreck. Debris, filthy diapers, and little bitty paper that looked like about the size of a postage stamp. had been cut up, looked like with scissors, all over the house and then looked like a small tornado had blown it everywhere. There was no sign of life, only signs of where life had been. My wife had obviously left me and taken the children. Why? Why now? Why after all those years of struggling and fighting, far and with each other, had she suddenly departed when things were going our way? Was she someone who couldn't handle success, or more precisely, was she someone who couldn't handle mine? I mean, my God, she knew what I was doing and where I was. She had made me more furious than anyone ever had. It wasn't right for her just to leave after staying with me through all the hard times. I asked Fuzzy to drive me to Leona's mother's house. Actually, I demanded that he take me. I was rude as only a young, hot-tempered kid from the streets would be. Fuzzy was my friend, and he'd never seen my temper before. He accepted me as I was. Besides, he knew that my fit that day was not directed towards Bonnie or him. I was right. Leon was at her mother's house. My car was parked in her driveway. When Bonnie and Fuzzy saw the car, they didn't want me to go inside. They were afraid I'd fight again with Leona. I assured them that I was only going to go inside for my keys, not for Leona. And I'm in it. As I walked past the parked car, I happened to look inside. The interior had been destroyed. The dash was caved in, and much of the instrument panel was lying on the floor. Glass was everywhere. Someone had undergone a hell of a fight in my car. It had been vandalized, and I didn't know which. I only knew I'd worked long and hard for that pretty 57 Chevy, and that I'd left it in Leona's care while I worked some more. What had happened to the most valuable material possession we owned? And why did she let it happen? I bolted into the house where Leona was standing with a man. He looked like an Indian. He was as big as an oak tree with arms. I forced myself to remain calm. I simply asked for the keys to our car. She threw them at me. What are you going to do? You're not going to whip my ass because my boyfriend's here? The word boyfriend in connection with a man's wife strikes an emotional chord. I didn't want my wife proclaiming she had a boyfriend. Rage overtook me. A tired and jealous man hearing his wife with a history of cheating talk about her current affair will cause you to lose control. I'm not excusing my behavior, just explaining it. I don't remember much, except that I whirled around and went for her throat. I didn't mean to hurt her, I meant to kill her. I knew exactly where I'd be, and exactly where I was gonna be. San Quentin, North Block, Death Row. I felt Fuzzy's hand on my arm, and reality began to come back into view. Fuzzy and Bonnie were intervening. Leona, now blue, lay collapsed on the floor. She was alive, but in the space of those moments, my love for her had died. Maybe I didn't kill her, but I killed the love. I picked up my kids at the babysitter's home and took them over to my mom's. I remember thinking at the time, she'll hurt nobody else. As my life began to settle down after our separation, Bonnie began to tell me her troubles. Now that was a switch. I was accustomed to her helping me with my life. I didn't give much thought to hers. Why should I? She had somebody. My best friend, Fuzzy Owen, and her had been going together for some 15 years. It's not like she needed a friend in me. I needed one in her. Or so I thought. I knew Bonnie was convinced that Fuzzy was seeing another woman. But still, that was none of my business and had nothing to do with the wrong things that I did coming up. Some 35 years later, the other woman, I might say, who is a great friend of mine, is still married to the great Fuzzy Owen. Neither Bonnie nor I, nor for that matter Fuzzy himself, could have predicted what was about to happen. Fuzzy and Bonnie and I became inseparable, but I found myself becoming increasingly drawn to Bonnie. I didn't tell Fuzzy, but I suspected he knew. Since I wasn't on tour, I didn't need a harmony singer or a band, but Bonnie was working every night somewhere. She knew that I had the hots for her, and Fuzzy was cheating on her. So she said goodbye to both of us and took a job in Alaska. that was to last about four months. They say absence makes the heart grow fonder, and that's a worn-out phrase that wouldn't be worn out if it weren't true. I went to the barrel house where Fuzzy was working in the band, and I asked him if he'd let me have Bonnie's number, and he gave it to me. I returned later to ask to borrow some money from him. I didn't tell him what I was gonna do with the money. Then I used the money I had borrowed from Fuzzy to fly to Alaska to see his girlfriend. My intentions were honorable, I think. Bonnie sensed what was going on when I called her, when I told her I wanted to work in Alaska. She was going to be working in Alaska for the next four months. And I knew that she had an in there and maybe could get me a job playing guitar. I told her, I said, hey, look, I'm in Seattle. And I've already got my ticket to Fairbanks. I'm coming to see you. And this is my last dime. Bye.\" When I stepped off the plane, Bonnie was there to meet me. It wasn't like the situation at San Quentin. And she had her boss with her, a fellow named Joe Cheeks. On the way into Fairbanks, old Joe promised me temporary employment. And at the end of the night, Bonnie and I went to separate rooms. Later, I lie in bed in the land of the midnight sun. and thought about this beautiful woman in the next room. I love to fall in love. It's so thrilling at the beginning, when the relationship requires no work, but generates such a passion. It wasn't long before passion found Bonnie and me. One of the most thrilling moments in my life occurred that night, as I saw Bonnie undress in the moonlight. In the spring of 1965, Leona Hobbs Haggard gave me a divorce. My mother had gained custody of my children in court. Because of my record, I was unable to do the same. On June 28, 1965, Bonnie Owens, the former wife of Buck Owens and former girlfriend of Fuzzy, became my lovely wife. I know Fuzzy was angry, and I know he was hurt. And I hurt for him, because I truly loved Fuzzy at the time. He'd done so much for me. And it was no intention of mine to hurt him. It just happened that way. My mother and Bonnie Owens helped me raise my four children as if they belonged to them. Bonnie was an excellent mother and an excellent homemaker. I mean, I was a provider. She gave the love and attention. I often did not. On November 18th, 1968, Capitol released a song called Sing Me Back Home. It was on the charts for 20 weeks in Billboard. Spent two weeks as number one. Everybody thought it was gonna be a big hit, even my publisher, which at the time was Blue Book Music, a company owned by Buck Owens. I'd made a lot of money and I'd adjusted well. Prosperity set well with me. I needed $15,000 since I owed five grand to some heavyweight Vegas gamblers. So I went to Buck for an advance against my royalties. I asked for $15,000. After a, ha, ha, ha, ha, he said, I'm not a loan company. We argued back and forth, but he said he wouldn't budge unless I sold him half the song. I needed the money, and I got it. while he got half the song, which was based on my experiences in San Quentin. Buck would earn his half of the money from sitting behind a desk. I earned my half doing time behind bars. Let me add, there was a check at that moment in Buck's desk that would more than cover what I needed. He just failed to mention it. Buck wasn't the first or the last to show me that the music business is more business than music. and that the business, unlike music, isn't always a pretty melody. A singer's most significant milestone is getting a recording contract. Probably the second most important would be getting his own band. The first person I hired was Roy Nichols, the little guy from Fresno that I idolized all my life. I drafted Roy from Las Vegas when he'd left Winn Stewart's show. Winn paid him $250 a week at that time, and he was so fed up with Las Vegas and the slot machines that he agreed to work for me for $125 a week. What a deal. Roy had three conditions for taking the job. He said, I don't drive, I carry my own amplifier, and I want to know where my place is to sleep. He said he'd sleep anywhere, even on top of the instruments, as long as he knew that that was a place he could rest every time he got tired. He's without a doubt one of the greatest and most mimicked guitar players in the entire world, and definitely one of the greatest I've ever known closely. Until the late 80s, every successful country singer had a signature instrumental sound. Roy created mine. You have no idea what an honor it was for me, then, and until the day illness forced his retirement to work with the great Roy Nichols. I've never known anyone that misunderstood each other more than me and Roy. Roy was always a perfect gentleman, but one time Roy was playing guitar in Buck Owen's studio during a recording session. At the end of the session, he and Buck had some words. As Buck turned to leave the studio, Roy hurled a solid body fender guitar that belonged to Buck directly at Buck. The door closed and the guitar hit the door just as it closed. I don't think Buck ever said anything out of the way to Roy after that. By the way, that old Telecaster guitar was still in tune when it hit the floor. In 1966, I bought a house at the mouth of the canyon just outside Bakersfield that became famous. An enormous quarter-inch scale railroad ran through so I could feed my fascination for trains. It had 750 feet of double main line. A lot of magazines carried this story, especially Life. The same year, when I was 29, I was riding a horse on my property. The horse threw me, I broke my back, and I crawled about 300 yards to the highway. I wish there had been more to the story, but that's about it. The doctors misdiagnosed me for five months, during which my back began to heal improperly. I'm lucky they didn't have to break it again. I worked shows the entire time and was actually relieved to find that the pain stemmed from a broken back. I had no idea what was wrong with me. When you're carrying that much pain for that long with no idea of the cause, it's frustrating. The hit records were coming consistently by the late 1960s. And that's one of the reasons it's hard to achieve longevity in music. People began to expect great product from a recording artist. If he doesn't give it to them, he'll fall fast. An artist can record 20 number one records and miss on a couple, and the record label will be whispering about dropping him. That has happened to some of my very best friends. In 1968, I had a number one record for two weeks with The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde. The song was a hit I knew because of the runaway success of the movie Bonnie and Clyde, starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway. Faye called me one night to say how much she enjoyed my song. And as she spoke, I could hear music in the background. The tune was Today I Started Loving You Again, the B-side of Bonnie and Clyde. It has been recorded more than 400 times by other artists and has been number one at least twice. A year earlier, I had made another standout memory. I was at Nashville's old Ryman Auditorium rehearsing for an evening show, I think for Kraft Music Hall. A man walked up to me. His pace was slow and his shoulders were slightly slumped, but the smile on Bob Will's face was still radiant. I'd met him a few times, and once later on, I even threw a party for the original Texas Playboys at my own home. We even put up a sign in front of the house that said, Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys appearing tonight, one night only. On that day at the Ryman, he and his guitar player Tag Lambert approached with little fanfare. He spanked me lightly on the cheek, much as the Italian folk do. I don't have a full band anymore, he said, as if I didn't know that the greatest, largest Western swing band in history had been disbanded. It's just tagging me now. We travel around the country, and we don't pay much attention to the new music. That is, until we hear your music come on. Then we turn up the radio. I prayed that you'd be number one, and you're in the top five, so part of my prayers have been answered already. Bob was referring to my current record having risen to number five. Hearing those words after being physically touched by Bob Wills' hand is another one of my favorite memories. Once I had a hit record titled, My Favorite Memory. The person I wrote it about is actually my least favorite memory. But that song applies in many ways to Bob Wills and his words that he said to me that day. I'd stood on people's shoulders to peek at him when I was just a kid. I even rode a bicycle one time out to Beardsley Ballroom and stood on the bicycle seat where I saw him, Junior Menard, Tommy Duncan, and the entire Texas Playboy Band in 1948. March 25, 1972 saw the release of Grandma Harp, a tune that became my 12th number one song. My sister Lillian later recalls how I had phoned her in the middle of the night for the details I needed to write a song about my maternal grandmother. Lillian, who's a bit more proper than I, wasn't amused when I woke her up with questions that could have waited until morning. I think she thought I might have been drinking a little bit. Four days before the release of Grandma Harp, I received an official document from the state of California. I had had no dealings with the state government since I was released from San Quentin 12 years earlier. But there it was. The California governor, Ronald Reagan, had granted me a full and unconditional pardon. Every felony, every misdemeanor was expunged from my record. I was no longer an ex-convict. I was Merle Haggard again. A45-200 existed no more. I later appeared on a television show with Reagan, a GOP fundraiser. A lot of Democrats didn't think that someone who sang about the working man's rights, as I had, should try to help a Republican win office. I don't judge a man by his politics any more than I judge a man by his color. Ronald Reagan helped me in a way no one else had and no one else could. When he called me for a small favor, I was more than glad to oblige. I involved myself again with the Republicans in 1973 when I played the White House at the invitation of the late Pat Nixon. She wanted me for her birthday party. Seems she was a big fan of all my records, especially Okie from Muskogee, a number one song for me in 1969 and 70. It remains my most requested tune. I got a lot of crossover play on that one due to its controversial content. The song couldn't have been more right-wing, so I was quite surprised when I was invited to appear on the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, a program that was eventually canceled for its left-wing humor. Hmm, I wonder what happened to the First Amendment there. I sang the song on a stool surrounded by a little bitty American flag. The hippie movement was pretty strong in those days, and protesting the war in Vietnam was a way of life, virtually on all college campuses. My song denied the use of marijuana and supported respect for the college dean. And the song was pro-establishment. Mrs. Nixon was a champion of law and order and regimentation. When I stepped off the airplane in Washington, a gust of wind caught my hat, sending it rolling down the runway through the grease. Didn't matter. I wore it that night to perform for the president at his black tie affair. Because it was St. Patrick's Day, the president's own tie was green. So I asked him to borrow it, and I wore it for a while. I had a hard time with the crowd. I was nervous. The lights were on bright. And President Nixon sat approximately three or four feet right directly in front of me. There must have been maybe 300 dignitaries and their wives present. And I started the set off with Jimmy Rogers' classic California blues because I knew the president was from California. I thought he might find favor with that. It took about half of the song before Mr. Nixon smiled at all. And as he smiled, I saw 300 dignitaries and their wives move ever so slightly just forward enough to see what the president's reaction would be to this. I didn't expect the crowd to be as receptive as a Texas honky-tonk, but I didn't expect them to be quite so reserved either. Later, I learned why things were so subdued. Earlier that day, Nixon had learned that the press had become aware of his participation in the Watergate burglary cover-up. There was a party after our show, but Nixon didn't stay long. We didn't see him again. One of the funniest stories that I remember in my entire life occurred that night at the White House. Louis Talley, the star of Bakersfield, went on to be what some people might term or describe as my press secretary. Louis had been called the press secretary many times by other people in the group. When we went to the White House that night, it was his desire to meet Ron Ziegler, because Ron Ziegler was the press secretary for the president. All in fun, of course. Without Louie being aware of his partner's true identity, he went to the bar with a guy that he called Horsefly. And him and Horsefly, Hossfly he called him, Hossfly sat there and they drank and they drank. The party lasted nearly all night. In fact, I think it was daylight when we left. But Louie kept saying, you know, I wonder if those Marines over there at the bottom of the stairs would let me and you go up and see Lincoln's bedroom. And Hossfly said, well, we can try. So they walked over to these full-dressed Marines, two of them on each side of the stairs. Lewis said, hey, boys. He said, what would be the chance of me and Hossfly taking a quick peek in on Lincoln's bedroom? And they didn't say a word. They just stared straight ahead. Finally, Lewis Talley and Hossfly convinced them that they'd only be up there just for a minute. So here they went up the stairs to Lincoln's bedroom. And that night, Lewis Talley told me the story from there. He said he laid down in the bed and he said, well, boys, I think I've done just about everything in my life that I want to do. He said, I have met the president of the United States, the current president. I am laying in Abraham Lincoln's bed. And he said, you know, if I could just meet old Ron Ziegler, I think my night would be complete. Standing at the end of the bed, Housefly introduced himself by calling Louie Housefly. He said, Housefly, shake hands with Ron Ziegler. When Charlie Duke, John Young, and Ken Mattingly flew to the moon back in April 1972 on the Apollo 16 mission, they took my music to play in the cockpit. Now that's a real honor, and it always will be. The rest of that story is that I later talked to Duke at a party at the home of former University of Texas football coach Darryl Royal. Duke told me that two UFOs followed the Apollo spacecraft from Earth to the moon. The UFOs disappeared in seconds after the touchdown. Duke even filmed the objects, but the footage was seized by the federal government as soon as they got back. Usually, UFO stories are second, third, and fourth hand. This was first hand from a man who had no reason to lie to me. In 1964, I was co-pilot of a small aircraft coming out of Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. I'd just gotten clearance to fly and was told by the tower to go on home, Mr. Haggard. Actually, I was en route from Lone Polk, California, back to Bakersfield. I dozed off, but was awakened by a brilliant light through the rear window of the Cessna 206. The entire cockpit was brighter than the desert at noon. The source of light was coming from behind us, but kept getting closer and brighter. It eventually soared over the top of our little aircraft. We radioed Vandenberg Tower. Hey, did you guys see something? The pilot asked. The air traffic controller said nothing. Well, did you pick up anything on radar? The pilot pressed. Something just flew over our heads. The voice answered, we didn't pick up anything on radar, and we didn't fire anything off. If they had picked up something on radar, I doubt that they would have said so. Because they declined to give any information tells me that we were not up there alone. I don't know what to make of that story, except it's one of hundreds of unexplained things that have happened to me in my life. Do I think the federal government has lied to us about UFOs? I'll answer that question with a question. Every president we've had since Nixon has lied. If the president lies, don't those involved with our nation's security lie as well? After all, the president is the commander-in-chief in charge of national security. After a lifetime of thought, I think that UFOs exist. In 1974, Bonnie Owens temporarily left my touring show again. It was the first of many steps that she would take before easing away from me professionally, and then personally, in a departure that resulted in divorce. She was flat burned out. The road is a man killer, and there's no measuring the emotional toll it takes on a woman. I never cease to be amazed at the people who think show people live glamorous lives. What the hell is glamorous about a 35-year bus ride? Bonnie got her fill. She decided to stay home with my children. We never had a child together. That woman, Bonnie, had packed my early recordings into mail pouches to send to radio stations. She'd sung harmony on nearly all of my hit records and had played on my stage. She had taken dictation of all of my early song lyrics whenever the inspiration came. A year after leaving my show, Bonnie sued me for separation and eventually for divorce. For a brief time, Louise Mandrell took Bonnie's place on stage. She later went on to star with her sisters, Barbara and Irene, in a network variety show. And today, she owns her own theater in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. I thought and thought about girl singers, and so did my band members. And Ronnie Reno was the first to suggest the woman who eventually became my third wife. I had earlier heard her recording voice, but I'd never seen her. So Ronnie set up a meeting at a restaurant on Nashville's Music Row. She came by the studio next day when I was recording, and I asked her if she sang harmony, and she said she would. Dolly Parton happened to come by also at the same time. A lot of folks in the room aware of my interest in each woman said they felt the tension. Some people feel tension too easily. My future third wife and I soon began to tour and sing together, and it was like my other courtships and marriages. It was passionate. We did nothing in moderation. We argued like tigers before and during the marriage. I could talk all about our courtship, breakups, wedding, ceremony, and life as man and wife, but I don't want to do that. I was bitter for a while. I'm no longer bitter. I can't remember what she even looks like, and I'd just as soon move on right here. I made a resolution I'd never again be used to further someone's musical career. I'd stay away from women in the business. So, I married my maid. Debbie Parrott worked at Silverthorne Resort and Marina because her sister and brother-in-law were owners of the business. She cleaned my houseboat and several others. She is an awfully good person. One of the most beautiful women I've ever met in my life. Boosting my spirits wasn't within her job's description, but she tried anyhow. She wasn't required to wash my clothes, but she did it anyway. She even washed the clothes of my guests on the boat. She was and still is a true friend. I was always attracted to her. I can remember seeing her smiling in a crowd, knowing that she was someone I'd like to be with, and she wasn't a singer. that made her twice as attractive. We were married, she remembers, at 7 a.m. by the pool at the house I had bought for wife number three. I remember why the ceremony was so early. We just wanted to start our life with a new morning. I think we both knew the same day that our wedding was a mistake. I loved Debbie, and I still love Debbie, as a friend. More like a sister, but not romantically any longer. I think she felt the same way the first day. So when people ask how long we were married, I often say, only one day. In 1984, I was dating a girl named Sabrina, regularly. In the next year, I began to see a woman named Teresa. She was soon to be my wife and give me a family and another chance to be a dad. I guess Debbie helped me the most during the death of my mother, Flossie. We had just pulled into a town in Arizona, perhaps Phoenix, for a show when we got the call letting us know that Mom was near death at a Bakersfield medical facility. I canceled the show, and Debbie went with me to Mom's bedside. Some of the last words my mother ever spoke from her deathbed went to Debbie. Take good care of him, Mom said. Debbie promised she would. That's a mutual feeling. I'll always take care of Debbie and her child should they need help. I was with Mom when she breathed her last breath. But there's a couple of things I want to document. She was catapulting with what was diagnosed as pneumonia, trying to pass away, trying to die. And someone whispered in my ear, if she only had a Valium, she could probably die easier. And I mentioned that to my sister and my brother. And they said, you know, you're probably right. I think it was somewhere around midnight when I called the doctor and woke him up. And I said, you know, I think my mother could go on and die. Relax and go to sleep if she only had a shot of Valium am I right? The doctor paused and he said we don't want any lawsuits. I said nobody is going to sue you if I'm right Would you please give my mother a shot of Valium and let her die? And he said give the nurse the phone that decision was mine and Lills and Lowell's And I pray that we made the right decision Mom had been a mother figure to my childhood friend, Dean, who was then my bus driver at the time of my mother's death. And when it occurred, he cried like a wounded lamb. I was too numb to exhibit emotion. A man can hurt too badly to cry, but tears would come in their own time. But I'll never forget how it affected Dean. I had cut an album two years earlier, composed entirely of Mom's favorite gospel songs. It was called For the Mama That Tried, the title play off my earlier hit, Mama Tried. It includes such standards as Precious Memories, Where No One Stands Alone, In the Garden, and Why Me, Lord, the great Kris Kristofferson song. I love those songs as much as my mom did. I can't describe the comfort they've given me over the years. Funny thing about show business is that when you're struggling, nobody wants anything to do with you. People will give you their business card and then not take your call. And when you're hot, everybody wants a piece of you. In the mid-1970s, I was asked to do a movie called Centennial. with Andy Griffith and David Jensen. What an honor. I'll never forget a story that Andy told me during the two weeks I spent with him in his green pickup on that set. Seems Andy was at a Hollywood party. He and this big-time director were out on the veranda, drinking and telling stories. They'd been out there about an hour, and most of the conversation had been about Don Knotts. And they needed new drinks, and they started back inside, and Andy said that the old man said to him, by the way, Andy, didn't you do something with Don? Of course, that's funny. But the man was serious. See why I don't like people who run show business? They may know something about the business, but they don't know anything about the show. Posing that question to Andy Griffith was like asking Santa Claus if he knew anything about Christmas. I was playing Harrah's Club in Lake Tahoe, probably the most uptown venue a country star could play in the 1970s, with the exception maybe of Carnegie Hall. But I'd also played Carnegie Hall. A particular show that was done in the afternoon was quite different than most shows at Harrah's. This show was for the employees. Not only the cooks and the waitresses and people that worked directly at Harrah's, dealers and such as that, but it was also for the other entertainers that worked for Harrah's. And most all of them were present. I was introduced, walked on stage, and the audience applauded as if they were asleep. I was doing my first song, wondering what the hell was happening, when somebody in the crowd jumped up and said, hey, what is wrong with you people? I put my hands above my eyes to shield him from the spotlight. The faceless voice continued to rant. This is the greatest country singer since Hank Williams. You act like it's a goddamn local act. You need to be balled out, and I'm a little short nigger son of a bitch that'll do it. Now try it. Try it again, Haggard. Walk off stage and come back and see if these son of a bitches will clap. I did. The place went ape. They had just been issued orders by Sammy Davis Jr. Bob Eubanks, host of television's newlywed game, was the only concert promoter I worked with for eight years. And I'm proud to say that he's the only one I really ever cared for, and I don't think we ever had a crossword during that time. But I'm proud to say I think he made money on most of my shows. He often said the hardest problem he had was getting me to do the one hour show I was usually contracted to do. A lot of people ask how I write songs and where the inspiration comes from. I have no set formula for creating songs. I get inspiration from different places. I'm not trying to avoid complicated answers, just giving an honest one. Eubanks reminded me recently of a song I wrote just before I broke up with Bonnie Owens. He thinks I'm most creative when I'm having trouble with a woman. Eubanks was boring me to death at a business meeting, and he could tell it. He was over-organizing. He wanted too many meetings too often. I'd much rather have been somewhere fishing or making music. Eubanks, nevertheless, was holding court, going on and on about something, when I said, hold everything. What? He said abruptly. I didn't know until years later just how irritated he was. I guess he'd put a lot of planning into what he thought was an important meeting. He probably thought I had my priorities wrong in wanting to break up this important meeting. But I was going somewhere to make music. Music was, after all, the reason all of us were there. Then Bob asked me some kind of question. Instead of an answer, I gave him a blank stare. He said years later, he thinks I wasn't paying attention. He's probably right. I've had this melody in my head all morning, I told him. What? He said again, still disbelieving that I would suddenly just walk out. I went out and I came back ten minutes later with Everybody Gets the Blues. The song went to number one on June 30th, 1972. I don't like to talk too much about songwriting because, as I say, I have no formula. I have a gift. It came from a higher power. I've used and abused the gift, but it miraculously remains intact. There are obviously some things that God wants me to say in song. I hope I've said something he agrees with. In 1985, I signed with Epic Records. My first single for the label was Kern River, a tune about a river that ran between Bakersfield and Oildale, separating the two cities. I still think Kern River is one of my best songs. I was riding high on the song when I went into another unnecessary meeting. This time with the president of Epic Records, Mr. Asshole himself. You know, asshole sometimes describes something that can be described with no other word. When I finished with this boring guy, I walked out of his office toward the downstairs lobby, where many of the songwriters were gathered for a party, many of which had come to sing songs for me. As we were headed to the party, this president decides to tell me one more time how much he didn't like Kern River. I had given this guy a hit, my very best, for the first release on his label, and he didn't like it. He didn't like the song. Music business executives don't know what they want. His remarks angered me, and I let him know it. One of the funny things that happened that day, if there was anything funny, Ray Benson had just signed with CBS and he didn't know that Mr. Asshole and I had a problem. And he'd been kind enough to drive me down there because my bus wouldn't fit between the CBS office and wherever they'd chose for me to park. When we finally got to the doorway of Mr. Asshole's office, there were some more songwriters just inside. And about that time, he told me once again that he didn't like Kern River. I said, we know I think that's about the third time you've told me that.\" And he come back with a real smart demeanor, and he said, I believe it's more like five. And I thought, well, I've took all I'm going to take. I said, let me tell you something, Mr. Asshole. I said, I'm about five times overdue telling you to go get fucked. And I said, and another thing, I understand you let Johnny Cash go from the label yesterday. Is that true? He answered it was. I said, so you dropped the man that built that chair for you over there, right? Tell me something. Where does a man like you come from? What are your credentials? Can you play a guitar? Can you write a song? How did you get here? He said, I'm an Ohio farm boy. I said, well, that ain't good enough, my friend. The argument went on for quite some time. It was quite embarrassing. I know for the people that couldn't get out of the room, I felt sorry for him. I felt sorry for Ray Benson because I knew he didn't want any trouble with Mr. Asshole. He just signed with CBS. I just didn't know about it. I stayed on this guy's label until 1989, captured. Then I left and made another mistake and went to another label that has no credibility, not even enough to be mentioned in this audio book. Veteran country music singers complain that contemporary radio won't play their new releases. And it's true. That bullshit label I was on wouldn't even print enough to go to the radio stations. There is nothing more frustrating than to be a recording artist who isn't recording or who, if he is, isn't getting his records released. You might wonder, why did the man sign me to his label to begin with? I wondered that myself. It took a while to find out. And so after 41 number one songs, the streak was over. Thanks to two indifferent and incompetent record executives, I had but one more number one record, Twinkle Twinkle Lucky Star. That was my last. Can I still make hit records? I don't say watch me, I merely say let me. Between recording companies that don't want to sign senior artists and those that won't release their products, coupled with radio stations that don't play them, well, it's bad news for veterans. I never thought I'd see such a day in country music. When I was a newcomer, my songs were played right along with the hits of Bob Wills, Lefty Frizzell, Hank Williams, Ernest Tubb, and the giants of the 1940s and 50s and 60s. Country music has long been known for loyalty to those who have historically influenced it. On the other hand, rock and roll has been known for its disloyalty. Rock stars at the time were hot one year, totally forgotten the next. Now, the opposite is true. Rock and roll is respecting the veterans, while country music shuns its heroes. Think about it. Rod Stewart, Tina Turner, Eric Clapton, the Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, Elton John, are only a few of those who emerged in the early 1960s and are getting more airplay and drawing bigger crowds than they ever did. Country music programmers could do better on modern radio. I can understand the absence of us veterans from the airplay list if we weren't so popular. I, for example, work about 151 nighters. Did so in 1998, at least. Could have worked every night of the year. I play for sellout houses in almost all kinds of venues. Among us, talking about the seniors, we probably account for 300 number one songs or more. Yet some new kid with a pretty face and new talent can record one song that reaches the number 50 slot and you'll hear the damn thing all the way across the dial every four minutes. People have asked me which one of all the thousands of shows I've done was the best. I can't name it. but I can remember the one that was the worst. It happened in Liverpool, the home of the Beatles. It had been a tough tour away from my own private bus. I hardly ever took uppers, but I was tired and I asked some of the guys if they had anything that might help me a bit. Somebody handed over half of what I thought was a Benny or a diet pill. That was the extent of my body's exhausted condition. Half of one of the pills would get me through two shows. And then I'd wind up wishing I hadn't taken that, because it'd be hard to come down. So I took this little half a pill, and not knowing that it was LSD. I went bananas. I thought I could see through my third wife's face. In fact, I'm sure that I could. This happened at three in the afternoon. The horror continued all throughout the evening. I'd never experienced anything like it. They say if you tell somebody he's on LSD, his trip will usually be good. They didn't tell me. I thought the building was 40 feet high and very narrow. I got terribly cold, and they put all sorts of blankets all over me, wrapped me in everything they could find, and I was still cold. My mind was playing tricks on me, and I still had to do two shows. All I remember is that horrible afternoon and finally making it to the microphone and maybe doing about 20 minutes. The second show, I don't remember at all. After the shows, Red Lane grabbed me, pulled me around a corner away from the show, and we headed into a dark diner. I was opening the car door when I heard a man say, get him. I could hear animals running toward me. I figured they were German shepherds, and they were. I couldn't see them. They got within inches of me, but evidently sensed what I was going to do, and they stopped short. Can't you guys read, some guy said. How in the hell could we read? We can't even see. We can't even see you. Who are you? This is my parking zone. Well, call your damned animals off, and we'll get out of here, I said. But if they move, You'll carry one of them away. I'll kill him.\" That was the end of the evening of what was probably the worst night of my life. Let me make one thing clear. In most of my entire life, I've never done drugs. But in the 1980s, things changed. I roared my way right through the 1980s, in fact, running and drugging the nights away, making bad decisions, maybe while under the influence of various substances. The non-stop marathon of miles, music, and mayhem were taking their emotional and financial toll. I made bad business decisions. As I said earlier, I had too often trusted the untrustworthy. The pressures of past debts and the pressures of new ones were overtaking me. After signing the deal with a record company that didn't promote me, the royalties of my record sales and radio airplay dropped off, seriously reducing my income. I had earned maybe $100 million in 25 years, but by 1990 I was practically broke, or at least that was what I was told. Miracles occur in the strangest of places, Willie Nelson once wrote. I can testify to that. I was playing at Silverthorne Resort, the joint in which I owned 49% of in 1986, when Clint Strong, then my lead guitar, had met a girl named Teresa. They headed off for exactly 24 hours. So he asked her to go on the next tour. We left town with her riding the band bus with Clint. The moment we met on the bus, there was something between us. Her face blushed, and I think mine did too. Everybody in the room knew it. I had an eye for her. She was tall, blonde, and striking. Beautiful in an understated way. Hers was a quiet appeal. I think it was two years before she said anything to me. I liked her, absence of pretense, and still do. That night we went on the first show. The band went on slightly ahead of me, a couple of songs at least. And Teresa was standing in the wings of the stage. And I walked up to her and I said, Teresa? I said, this is my room key. Take this and go to my room and don't come out. Clint Strong is no longer with the show, and his discharge had nothing to do with Teresa. Teresa Haggard would eventually replace my restless spirit with a peaceful soul. Falling in love with her was the beginning of the end of my rough and rowdy ways. I give God and Teresa the credit. God bless. When Teresa reads an account of my outrageous behavior, she throws down the article without finishing. I don't read that junk. That's not the Merle Haggard I know. I wasn't always a perfect father. I was absent during my first four children's upbringing. I've already said how much I regret that. One of my daughters, during the 1997 tribute to Merle Haggard that aired on the Nashville Network, said I had trouble expressing my feelings. She said I never told her I loved her, but that I often picked up a guitar and sang a song to her to let her know that I did. Well, I'm telling her and all my children right here in my own words, I love you. And I regret my part of the wrongs that's happened over the years. Forgiveness for old transgressions is the desire of the day. Loving each other is the desire forever. God help us love each other. Today, our four-member family takes time many times every day for a circle of prayer. Teresa, our two children, and me. People that haven't been around me in years probably wouldn't know me. I spend my days chasing bass with my family, not chasing women with my buddies. Freddie Powers says the change is tremendous, but it wasn't abrupt. Before we were married, Teresa and I lived on my houseboat for five years, carefree and free-spirited. The published accounts about our drug abuse is simply not true. There was drug use, but only for a short time was it abused. My children don't have to learn from their mistakes. They can learn from mine. Teresa and I would cry many times together about the loss of our first child. I was 50 years of age and wondered why God had let me sire a stillborn child. Someday I'll ask Him. When I was 54, Teresa became sick again. Pregnancy once more did not enter our minds. A baby girl is the epitome of fragile innocence. I have to confess I feared fatherhood. My attitude changed as soon as I laid eyes on the tiny living symbol of our love. It had been a stressful day, and Teresa had trouble delivering. She had toxemia. Labor was induced, and the baby finally came by way of cesarean. I think I felt a baptism of change wash over me when the nurse put Janessa in my arms. It didn't slow my reckless ways. It brought them to an abrupt halt without even realizing it at first. Janessa, like Ben, was a godsend. And let me tell you how I know. Teresa was seven months into her pregnancy when I awoke from a dream. And I hardly ever dream. But I'd heard this voice just as clearly as I'd ever heard a voice in my life. It sounded like the voice of God. It said, this child's name shall be Janessa Rowena, the voice commanded. I immediately awakened Teresa to tell her our search for a name had ended. Write down this name. She fumbled in the darkness for a pen. She couldn't find one. So the first time Teresa ever wrote Janessa Rowena, she did so on scrap paper with an eyebrow pencil. We later looked up the name Janessa, which we'd never heard, in a name book and found that it meant child of God. This may all sound like something out of the Old Testament, but it's true. To me, it's a beautiful story that I tell as truthfully as I told those many that weren't so beautiful. If you get a chance, ask Teresa if she thinks I heard the voice of God, and she'll answer yes without a moment's hesitation. Within six months of Janessa's birth, we were off the houseboat. We were afraid our child might fall in the water and drown. We haven't lived on the boat since. We left it and all our rowdy behavior at the dock on Lake Shasta. But before we made that move, I had to find a place for my family to live. I still had the big house that I'd bought for my third wife, but Teresa didn't want to live there, and I didn't either. I decided to remodel and expand an old cabin on our land. The place was about to fall down. The first day I considered redoing it, I was greeted with a moo. When I pulled up to the front door, a cow was standing in the middle of the front room. I don't think anybody but me saw the place's potential. I worked the spring and the summer of 1990 with contractors, and I wanted our new home to be a surprise. You'll have to trust me, I told Teresa. I'm going to leave every day, and I don't want to tell you where I'm going. The workmen and I tore down walls and put up new ones. We shoveled out debris and laid carpet and tile. We painted and papered. And we did it all after significant structural changes and rewiring and re-plumbing the place. What a mess. When the work was nearly completed, I got Teresa in the car and I drove up the back way to the cabin. She'd never seen the place before and didn't know it existed. When I drove up, I said, how do you like it? It's beautiful, she said, not believing her own eyes and not believing it was ours. Baby, this is our new home. She cried instantly. We moved in eventually, me, Janessa, and Teresa. and we live there to this day. Our land is overrun with game. Deer roam like cattle over the 191 acres. Wild turkeys are everywhere. One turkey took up with the chickens and now oversees them and is the boss. It actually thinks it's a rooster, I believe. We have that wolf Teresa raised from a cub and she feeds it dog food. The wolf is so tame that it probably couldn't make it in a while. The family and I fish a lot in the ponds and we often eat what we catch. The landscape is thick with roses and wildflowers, wild grapes and berries. You couldn't be more homey. There's no place I'd rather be and no people I'd rather be with than my home and my family. Teresa got pregnant again when I was 56. I'm going to have a son, she announced one day. She hadn't seen a doctor or taken a home pregnancy test. She wasn't even late for her period. She just knew she was pregnant, and she knew it was a boy. Having a doctor eventually confirm it was nothing more than a formality. What do you mean we're going to have a son? Are you pregnant? The doctor made the confirmation six weeks later. My family was meant to be. I wasn't afraid during Ben's delivery as I had been during Janessa's. In fact, I participated, or at least I tried. Teresa again had trouble, and there was another cesarean. They put my last child and youngest son in my arms, and he's been in my heart ever since. At the age of five, Ben Haggard announced that he intended to die in the house where he now lives. He said this was his place. And as far as I'm concerned, it is. May he and his children grow old here. Teresa and I got married on our own land in a ceremony performed by my friend Tommy Collins. A few hundred guests came to watch us take our vows as the sun went down. Happiness exhibits itself. Teresa and I wear it like a shine. My children only leave home to go to school, and even that may cease in the fall of 1999 when we start a homeschool program. Teresa and I love to see the personalities of our children unfold without the influence of other youngsters. I want my kids to have their own identities, not some of some other child's. I come home off the road with plans to go somewhere with my family, but we rarely leave. We rarely want to. I still go on the road, but that'll stop. The year 2000 will mark my last highway marker. After 37 years, I'm doing my farewell tour, and I'm so glad. Lately, we've been thinking about moving to Louisiana, where my band can play almost every night and I can sing whenever I want to. The traveling Merle Haggard will be no more. But you know, I heard someone say the other day, if you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans. Morning finds the family and me at one of our ponds after breakfast. Before we leave our house, Teresa always puts on a pot of beans or maybe black-eyed peas. There's something warm and secure about having a pot of beans on the stove. Teresa is a gardener's gardener. She breaks the ground in the spring with a rototiller and would use a tractor with a plow if I'd let her. On Bended Knee, she plants tomatoes, peppers, lettuce, spinach, broccoli, celery, onions, garlic, corn, squash, black eyes, purple hulls, and watermelons. She tries to can and store what we don't eat for the winter. If someone asked me what I love most about Teresa, I might say I love how she loves me. The woman's every thought is to attend and please her family. Then there are the little things. She knows I'm crazy about Bob Will's music, so she puts it on the stereo as soon as she thinks I'm up and around. Or she'll rotate it with Bing Crosby, Milton Brown, or Emmett Miller, or maybe Old Lefty. She wants to go on the road trips like old times, even when she knows she has to stay with the kids. And it breaks my heart to tell her no. And it breaks her heart to hear it. But we're both glad she asks. In the old days before the children, after dark on Lake Shasta, we used to fish for bass in the nude. Sometimes we'd lay our poles down. I'd be hard-pressed to pick a favorite memory from those made with my family, with Teresa. I've had houses before, but this time I have a home. And I've had wives before, but this time my wife is my best friend and my lover. There are some people who wish they had our place and our land and everything that goes with it, and they almost did. Here he is, Mr. Haggard, the nurse said as she handed Ben to me seven years ago. The next touch I felt was a stranger. He too handed me something. With my baby in one hand, I held a court paper in the other. It said I was being sued by my creditors for failure to pay my debts. Once again, I was paying a high price for cheap thrills and bad decisions. I was dunned at one of the most memorable moments of my life. Some members of my band were shocked in 1997 when I announced on national television that I was broke. The word is now an exaggeration. People couldn't understand how I could make and lose so much money in one lifetime. Really, it's none of their business, but neither is much of what I've discussed in this program. I'm not entirely free to discuss my finances because of lawsuits against some of the people who helped squander my money through the conflicts of interest and old-fashioned dishonesty. People have no idea, absolutely no idea how much overhead an entertainer incurs and how difficult it is to monitor the incoming and outgoing cash. It would take a graduate degree in accounting and a staff of professionals just to stay abreast of tax laws. When your performance and travel schedule consumes 80 hours a week, there's no time to address your cash flow, even if you have financial knowledge. I can't get away with filing a simple short form for my taxes. It's just not that simple. So I hire people to wade through the financial maze. I have freely admitted to squandering money on high times and impulse spending, so I accept my part of the blame. But I'm not passing the buck when I say the main reason for my financial woes is that I trusted the untrustworthy out of necessity. I was too busy making money to have time to manage it. I know many people never understood how Willie Nelson wound up owing the Internal Revenue Service $17 million. I do. It was a lot easier monitoring my money when I was working for $150 a week and had no employees than it was when I was earning $30 million a year and transporting 40 people 500 miles a day. In show business, you work to build a career. When it finally takes off, it can overtake you. You think about slowing down, but wonder if you'll always be in such demand and remember the time when you weren't. So you ride the rocket as far as it'll go and as fast as it'll take you, at the expense of everything else, including your expenses. Rose Waters has been a source of financial salvation. She and I earlier got a real wake-up call. I bought something for $11 and paid with a credit card. The card probably had a limit of about $5,000. The $11 purchase was declined. How much have you put on the card, she asked. Rose, that's the first time I've ever used that card in my life. She found out that people in my organization who had no official reason for the card had a copy nonetheless. She put a stop to that. And she put a stop to a lot of other things. And she was quick to reveal people to me that weren't my friends. Thanks to you, Rose. I love you for it. And thanks to you, Jay. I love you both. On March 15, 1999, I returned to my story's starting place. I went to Bakersfield. Memory Lane can be a bumpy road. I thought the trip to Bakersfield might be unpleasant, and it was. In fact, at times it was traumatic. Memories can hurt and heal you at the same time. I went past the Shell station I'd once robbed by pretending to be an employee. I drove past the grade school I'd attended for seven and a half years before I was expelled. I drove to the intersection where five days a week my mother would catch a bus. to her job at the meat company. I stopped in the intersection and looked at the cracked sidewalks in what was once Bakersfield's nicest suburb. It's now rather run down. People would have no idea that the grandest lady of them all once waited patiently on this corner so she could work for minimum wage to raise a son who'd eventually piss away millions gambling and bad investments, ex-wives and attorneys, Today, she's a few miles away in a grave, but I could see her standing there waiting for a bus that had long since stopped running that route. I swear I could see her, even through the tears. There's been talk of naming a boulevard after me in Bakersfield. Rose is all for it. Me, I'd rather see a bronze statue of my mother, sack lunch in her hand, print dress to her calves. There, erected on that corner. And then I arrived at 1303 Yosemite Drive. Funny what numbers sometimes insinuate. My cell number in San Quentin was 4B13. I guess God wants to know where you're at. There was nothing there but another run-down house, just an address. Behind the house, however, sat another. Its decay was more striking. It was long, rectangular, and empty. It had once been a boxcar, and then the home of James and Flossie Haggard. My first home had ridden the rails before I was ever born, and I suspect It'll still stand after I've been laid to rest. Two young men emerged from the house in front. Hello, I said. I used to live in that house behind yours. I wonder, could I go through it? My name is Merle Haggard. The young men said they knew who I was and expressed surprise that I was there. They'd heard that I'd been born in that boxcar behind their house. The white stucco interior was stained. Plywood covered the windows, through which I had marveled at the passing tank trains as a lad. I was glad my mother couldn't see it. She had taken meticulous care of our home, both inside and out. Flowers had graced the yard, and the lawn was always mowed and trimmed as neatly as a golf course. The driveway to the street was lined with poplar trees. There were also nectarine trees on the place. I earned my first money as a child selling nectarines. As I walked through the place, I saw once again the first bathtub I'd ever seen in my life. My dad made it by hand out of concrete and steel. I walked out back into the washroom, a room that held a ringer washer Mom used every Monday. I don't know why Monday was always wash day for the working class people, but it was. I remembered how Dad had painted the entire interior with a brush. Maybe I'm only talking about two or three hundred square feet, but they were so proud of it. On that March morning, I returned to my old home place. The room that had been mine was covered with felt-tipped sketches of naked women and graffiti. I wondered what Mama would have thought of that. The double bed had a bare mattress that was covered with urine and other stains. There were no other furnishings. I'd been in jails that were less stark and more sanitary. My dad would have died again. if he could have seen what had happened to the home he worked so hard to build and mom struggled so hard to decorate. They were poor, but they were proud, and their belongings were modest. But they were clean, and they were in place, always in place. No one lives in the house today, and that's good. The two young men were kind to let me walk through the place. I think they were embarrassed at what I saw. They kept apologizing for its appearance and talking about the improvements that they were going to make someday. They seemed to be good old boys, so maybe they'll get it done one of these days. But it'll never be the wood in the stucco jewel box it had been at the hands of James Haggard. Dad could do anything with his hands. I put my hands on the solid wood cabinets that he'd built with his hands. The old house was humid and it was rainy that morning. Windows were left open. For all practical purposes, those cabinets had been exposed to the elements for all those years. Yet not a single shelf was warped, not a single side curved. I started back through Bakersfield. I drove past China Grade, where Tommy Collins wrote his great song, High on a Hilltop, a song on one of my early Capitol albums. Tommy could see the lights of Bakersfield and was inspired to write that song. On that March 1999 morning, I pulled up to what was once my office in the early 1970s. I hadn't been inside the building for years. Some graves lie exactly 200 steps from the front door. I know. I walked them off. I bought the Bakersfield office building in the 1970s. At least four years passed before I walked across the street to my dad's grave. I don't know why I waited. He'd been there, dead since 1946. Mom had died in 1984. She was buried beside him. Next to her was my brother, who had died in 1986. Cancer took him after a long, agonizing effort to live. Bill Ray, my beloved brother-in-law, Lillian's husband, is also buried in the family plot. He was working for the former California governor, Ronald Reagan, when Ronald Reagan gave me my pardon. As I stood above Dad's grave, my mind raced in reverse. I remembered how strong he was, how he smelled of tobacco, how he feared nothing, and how he was so sensitive. How many thoughts can a man's mind process at the same time, I wondered. Death touches everyone, eventually. When it touches your family, it stings as if it's never touched anyone else. I thought about how Lowell had tried to help run my enterprises, and how we disagreed. how I had admonished Mom about my behavior when I was young, and how I'd refused to listen to him, and how much I wished I had of. And then, I stood above Mom's stone. Flossie Haggard, 1902 to 1984. I thought of the times I'd lied to her, and how proud she was of my success. of the song Mama tried and how she always wanted me to be a gospel singer. She loved my gospel songs more than any others. My mother was Oklahoma penmanship champion when she was a girl. She wrote in a cursive as elegant as English script. A few months before passing, she wrote her life story in longhand. She said she'd write more later, but later for her never came. She covered 82 years and 68 pages. I'm mentioned twice. My name appears for the first time on page nine, and again on the fourth page from the last. The first mention is about my song, Daddy Frank. In the second, she wishes I was a full-time Christian singer. That was the long and the short of the discussion about me. Mom's first recollection was of throwing her tiny hand into a hot coal when she was three. Her mother, Zona, was boiling soap in a cast iron skillet. Mom also wrote that she remembered traveling by covered wagon from her native Arkansas to Indian Territory, Oklahoma. Mom as a child lived in an earthen dugout with windows at ground level for their parents, grandparents, and aunts and uncles. Imagine their walls and floor were dirt. Oklahoma is notorious for the torrential rains that flood the flatlands in the spring, leaving the ground as mushy as meal. The water must have turned the dugout into a giant underground mud hole. Mom's autobiography talks about half-naked Indians who rode up to the earthen home on horseback and how her mother feared them and their dress, or the lack of it. Mom remembered seeing a talking bird, a parrot, in 1909 in Atoka, Oklahoma, which in 1977 was the site of the largest outdoor country music concert ever held. In the feature film made from the event, Hollywood spliced in entertainers who weren't even there. For example, Marty Robbins. Mom wouldn't have approved of that deception and actually thought she was being deceived when she saw that talking bird nine years after the turn of the century. Mom wrote that she remembered fighting mosquitoes and the malaria that they carried, the way someone would fight disease today in a third world country. Her dad, she wrote, bought some patent medicine, probably from a touring medicine man, after being assured that it would cure his malaria. He doubled up on the dosage and went insane and was committed to a sanitarium for a period of four months, she recorded. When mom was six, she saw her grandpa William Harp kill a rattlesnake so long that it dragged on the ground when he slung it over his shoulder. and the man was more than six feet tall, she wrote. I suppose some folks think that that's a tall tale. Well, they've never lived in rural Oklahoma, parts of which are just as gnarly today. Standing above Mom's grave, I thought about all the sacrifices that she'd made as a child and a young woman. It seemed so unfair that she had to live that way all the way into young womanhood. and that the best home she'd ever had to that point was a converted boxcar. I wish I'd have thought of that when I was younger. The following statement isn't very original for a regretful son. It's just very sincere. I wish I had known her better and appreciated her more. I suddenly just wanted to be home with Teresa and the kids, but we had a show to do that night. I left Mom's grave well before noon that morning and walked past each family plot a final time. Then I made my way to the car. I found my way out of that cemetery, perhaps forever, without once looking back.",

I've had a blessed life, despite many lows, many of which were of my own doing. There have been times when I simply could not see the light at the end of the economic, romantic, psychological, or emotional tunnel. I've lived through 17 stays in penal institutions, incarceration in state prison, five marriages, bankruptcy, a broken back, brawls, shooting incidents, swindlings, sickness, the death of loved ones, and more. And I've heard 10,000 chant my name when I couldn't hear the voice of my own soul. And I wondered if God was listening, and I was sure that no one else was. My unhappiness at times was so overwhelming, if anyone had ever told me that I'd be as content as I am today, I would have thought they were talking about someone else. So I decided to share what has worked for me, knowing it'll work for others. I'm a little embarrassed about some of the stories I'm gonna tell. They're more like confessions than mere reporting of events. And I really can't tell you how high I've been unless I tell you how low I sunk. Today at times I have peace of mind, the love of God, a good woman, and a family. Today I'm on track, or at least that's what they tell me. People milled nervously, fidgeting and looking at their feet the way folks do when embarrassed or angry. They gawked at what they probably thought was a madman in swimming trunks on a mammoth boat in front of them. He was yelling profanities that echoed across northern California's sprawling Lake Shasta for hundreds of yards, as sound does on water. No one had the right, the crowd obviously thought, to talk to his grandmother that way. Suddenly, he noticed the crowd gathering before the boat, tied up at Silverthorne Resort Marina near Jones Valley, and he smiled sheepishly. The expressionless people continued their silent vigil. Decent people hate people who abuse their elders almost as much as they hate those who abuse children. It's not what you think, the man on the boat tried to explain. He dropped below the deck, sounded like a man yelling from inside a cave. Eventually, he emerged from the boat with a teacup poodle. The people looked at each other and then back at him. It was clear they thought he was the vilest man on earth. The hostile group didn't appear to buy the yarn that he had a dog named Grandma. Still the man stood there holding the hapless dog in the air, its limp tongue hanging out of its toothless mouth. The sight of the pitiful pooch did not bolster the man's credibility. Everyone in the crowd would later tell friends about the creep at the marina. They had seen Freddy Powers, my long-time salt-writing partner who shared a houseboat next to mine, from about 1982 until about, oh, it must have been 1988. He really was yelling at a little dog that had been abandoned by its owner and had wandered its way into our party. And we paid substantially to have its teeth pulled and bones repaired. The veterinarian said without dental work, the dog would have died from infection. Freddy saved the dog's life by subsidizing its medical care, but his kindness toward the pooch had backfired on him that day at Silverthorne Resort. In those days, if I wasn't on tour, I was on my houseboat. I had a big house I had bought for my former wife and me, but I lived mostly on the boat. That's where I had the party to end all parties, an exercise in decadence that lasted a full five years. I went to the boat to get over a woman by partying away what I thought would be the last few years of my life. I didn't expect to live to be 60, not the way I had lived and not the way I was living. It was like the man who consumes alcohol, a depressant because he's depressed. I thought I was going to die young because of my reckless lifestyle, so I accelerated the recklessness. I was once off the road for 31 days, and for 31 days I never left the water. I had my toothbrush tied to the accelerator on my bass boat and let it dangle in the clear, icy waters of Lake Shasta. I'd pull it from the water when needed and jump in the lake with a bar of soap to bathe. We put cayenne pepper and lemon in our drinking water and our skin was as clear as a model's. Snorted cocaine womanized and hid from my personal pain during a binge that almost claimed my life on at least two occasions. In fact, five men shared four boats at our T-shaped dock. A woman wasn't safe, and her reputation was quickly shot if she came down there. Freddie bought an ultralight pontoon aircraft, which he had no idea how to fly at the time. and I had a pilot's license and taught him what I knew from the ground. I couldn't join him on his maiden flight because his plane held only one person. He eventually used it to fly around the lake to locate women who were sunbathing in the nude. There's plenty of that in the wooded coves on Lake Shasta, for that matter, throughout California. Freddie would call me while he was in flight to announce the location of the Sunbathers, or he'd wait until he flew back to the boat to tell me. He'd land his aquaplane on the water in front of the dock. Since I was living there anyhow, and since I thought I saw potential in the Silverthorne Resort, I bought ownership in the place. I turned it into a $14 million losing business venture for myself, mostly due to my inexperience. It was the second worst financial mistake of my life. In 1976, I sold 25 Wendy Burger franchises for a mere $265,000 because someone told me that the burger chains were going broke and that Wendy's would never make it. Can you imagine? I could have kept 25 of those cash cows in Southern California, the fast food capital of the world. Can you imagine what those things would have been worth today? I'd break your calculator. At Silverthorne, I opened a nightclub and a restaurant, and I beefed up the marina, rented cabins and 32 houseboats to tourists, and had concerts for them, too. Some of the biggest names in country music came to perform. The celebrities often stayed on the boat near mine as my guests. I had visitors from all over the country, but lost money nevertheless, due to the unfair business practices of the people I was in business with. I had foolishly bought only 49% interest in the resort. Since my partner kept 51%, he had final say on everything. Not long after we started our association, he beat me out of $400,000. He needed that much money to build the kind of bar I had envisioned. I designed an incredible nightclub and listening room. My partner went to the bank and borrowed money, the $400,000 that we needed to build the joint. He also took the $400,000 that I offered him without saying that he'd borrowed the other money in my name. People have asked, who was managing your affairs at the time? The answer is no one. I had fired my business manager and blew the Silverthorne project all by myself. By 1990, seven years later, I was still paying off debts that I had incurred while owning the place. My cash flow was down, my overhead was increasing, the indebtedness overtook me. According to terms of the bankruptcy settlement, I've been paying a certain percentage on the dollar for every debt I owe in connection with Silverthorne Resort. Under those arrangements, I have paid all creditors in full. I simply didn't take care of business because I wanted the business to take care of itself while I rocked on with my reckless lifestyle. I simply let my late partner handle the business, and I handled the lifestyle that went along with owning a nightclub and resort. We had a wet t-shirt contest on the dock every Wednesday night after Silverthorne's weekly water skiing show. The late Lewis Talley, who produced my first records, was known as the hoser, because he would hose down the contestants. We gave the cash prize to the winner, and secretly, Freddie and I told the judges to select the sexiest girl to win second prize. Her prize was to ride on our boat up Pitt River with Freddie and me. It's amazing how beautiful and intelligent women will compromise themselves just to be with a well-known entertainer. A famous female singer and I once spent five days nude on the boat. We snorted cocaine the entire time and didn't go to bed once. I guess I was burned out on the entertainment industry. I'd won every major award it offered and was headlining shows in front of tens of thousands of people. By 1980, I had recorded 25 number one records, seven that had reached number two in Billboard's magazine surveys, I had been nominated for nine Grammys and had won one Grammy, and had been named Entertainer of the Year by the Country Music Association, the highest honor the CMA bestows. And I'd been to the White House on several occasions. During the 15 years it had all happened, I'd been riding a crowded tour bus back and forth across America several times each year. I knew every interstate highway and major truck stop from sea to sea. Feeding my building burnout was the fact that I had done all the network television and motion pictures I wanted. I even had a role in a Clint Eastwood film and a song in his soundtrack. The highest number ever recorded by a living country music soloist, I'm told. My then wife saw that our relationship was impossible. The more I lived with this hurtful and stormy relationship, the more hurtful and stormy it became. I gave her a chance to tell her side of the story on this audio program, and she declined. It was one of the best things that ever happened to me. I was born April 6, 1937 at Kern General Hospital in Bakersfield, California. My dad, James Haggard, had heard about a boxcar that he thought could be converted into a home. And he did, despite discouraging remarks from its owner about his plans. Dad had moved to Oildale, a suburb of Bakersfield, from Oklahoma earlier that year. His barn had burned by lightning or arson to the ground, and he left because of that. He did not yield to the Depression or the elements, like some of the others did. He simply lost everything he owned and had nowhere else to go except California. The boxcar he converted into a house was the first home I ever ran away from as a boy. It sat in a row of houses and still stands today, 62 years later. I guess one of my earliest memories of life in the boxcar has to do with my dad taking me to buy a puppy when I was three. I can't remember the names of some of the worthless record company executives or parole officers I've dealt with, but I can remember the man that supplied my first Fox Terrier. I've had a dog ever since, except when I was in prison. My first greatest hits album, released around 1970, has me on the cover with my late dog Tuffy, who traveled the country with me on my tour bus. Today I've got dogs, farm animals, and even a wolf at my place near Reading, about 150 miles south of the Oregon border. People walk onto my property and say, is that a German shepherd? It's so big, it looks like a wolf. My wife, Teresa, always wanted a wolf, and we got ours when it was just a cub. A veterinarian said the animal would mistake her for its mother if she slept with it. So there we were, the three of us, in bed, my wife, my wolf, and me. She breathed into the nostrils of that thing one night, and today the wolf is as gentle as any old hound. Because I was 14 years younger than my brother and 16 years younger than my sister, I developed a love for animals. I allow no hunting, and I even have a wild turkey that thinks it's a chicken. Each lays her eggs in about the same place daily, and Teresa gathers them up. My childhood in Oildale was the most peaceful time of my life. I hadn't yet developed the restlessness that haunted me in my teenage years. I was content to play with my dog and go fishing with my dad. He used to drive home from church with two wheels on the railroad just to make me laugh. I loved the fact that he'd do most anything to make me laugh. About the only things I disliked as a child were church and school. Church meant dressing up and sitting too long in one place, while some man hollered and folks listened. I was never a good student because my mind was always somewhere outside the classroom. I wanted to make it, although I didn't realize it at the time. The remainder of my childhood world was running with a few pals and fishing the Kern River with Dad. In the 1940s, divorce wasn't commonplace the way it is today. That was the natural order of things, which I took for granted as much as the next sunrise. Parents didn't leave and they didn't die, or so I thought. In 1946, my world collapsed faster than Dad's burning barn back in Oklahoma. Church was a regular part of life among 1940s working folks, and we were no exception. One Wednesday night, Dad, an employee of the Santa Fe Railroad, had to work on a train wreck, so Mom and I went to the prayer meeting without him. I was nine, and I remember that another kid and I would turn over garbage cans as we came home from the prayer meeting in an act of rebellion because we didn't want to go to church to begin with. I remember walking home with Mom that night wishing that she wasn't there so I could turn over a couple of garbage cans. I went ahead of Mom into our little house where Dad had turned on one light. Unknown to Mom and me, he had dragged himself from the car into the house. His left side wouldn't work, so he couldn't shift the car gears. Dad was sitting with one leg propped on a rocking chair and the other on another chair, a dull expression on his face. Mama came in almost immediately after me, and I was still staring in shock at Dad. Mama, I've had a stroke, he said, as my mother followed me into the room. Dad explained how he'd stopped his car at the stop sign and signaled to make a left turn. He put his arm out the window and it fell to the side. Unable to change gears, he slowly chugged home into the yard, then began his crawl up to the house, half his body out of commission. When Dad left the hospital that coming Saturday, he seemed fine, feeling it return to his arms and legs. but the doctors wanted to take him to the Santa Fe Hospital in Los Angeles for some tests. My brother Lowell and his wife, Fran, Mom, Dad, and I went to the Santa Fe Hospital, where Dad was scheduled to be admitted at 1 p.m. We arrived early and had a picnic near the hospital. Why don't we leave him here on the blanket while I take you around to check you in? Merle's going with us, Dad said firmly. Mom was usually the boss, and Dad, the backbone of the family, usually let her have her way. From inside the hospital, a nurse brought a wheelchair. Do you really want me to use that, Dad asked? Might as well take advantage of it, she said. He was about to humor the nurse by easing into the chair. I heard someone knock on the door at about three o'clock in the morning. Then the sound of low voices, followed by Flora crying. I was already out of the bed when Lowell came into the room. He grabbed me and held me and said, we ain't got no daddy anymore. I first ran away from home at the age of 11, a couple of years after my dad's death. Mom tried everything to tap my interest, which certainly wasn't in academics. She signed me up for violin lessons, but every time the teacher would turn her back, I entertained the class with San Antonio Rose and You Are My Sunshine. I'd already heard Bob Wills and the other western swing bands of that day. The teacher told my mom the violin lessons were a waste of money. My sister thinks I blame myself for the fact that Mom had to work to support me. My sister Lillian and my brother Lowell were old enough to get jobs on their own. My sister even thinks my guilt was so intense that it spawned my need to run away. I should have removed our door and erected a swinging gate to accommodate my departure and then my returns after capture. When Lowell told me that night that we ain't got no daddy, well, I disagreed. Today, when friends and relatives are in trouble, people give money or goods. After Dad died, my mother had the wisdom to know I needed a positive role model in my life other than Lowell, who was 14 years older. So she arranged for me to spend the summer with my great-aunt Willie and my great-uncle Esker in Houston, California, near Modesto. They lived inside one room and used the wood stove for heating and cooking. If you were wet and cold, you had to stand right next to them to get warm because they didn't propel heat very far. If you wore denim and stood inches from the stove, its heat would dry your pants. So when you took a step and the back of your trousers touched your skin, it would burn like fire. To walk away from the stove in denim pants, you had to walk without bending your knees to keep from scalding your skin. So we stood by the stove, then walked around the house stiff-legged until our pants cooled. It's a rite of passage when a boy is allowed to call his elders by their first name. I learned to hop a freight train about the time most boys learned to ride a two-wheel bicycle. Today, smart parents wouldn't even let 10-year-olds operate a power lawnmower. I was prepared to ride a freight train with hobos and ex-convicts, murderers, and burglars when I was at that age. Truant officers eventually came to know me by my first name. They always took me to the principal, who usually sent me home. And I was fine with that, but it never made sense to me. They sent me home from school because I refused to go to school. So I conspired with my buddy Billy Thorpe, who had lived down the street back in Oildale. There had to be life outside Houston and Oildale, and we were going to see it all. We weren't old enough to drive and didn't know how anyhow. Besides, how would two boys get past the ticket master? I decided we'd take a freight train. During the next 18 hours, we planned what we thought would be the journey that would last the rest of our lives. We agreed to meet after school, the last day that we thought we'd ever attend, carrying all the worldly goods we'd need inside pillowcases. The train slowed down for an area just outside Aldale, and I climbed up into a hopper car, and we found a place to ride next to the wheels. Soon it picked up speed, and we were headed toward what we had planned to be Modesto, where we could pick peaches and make a living forever. It was after midnight when the train pulled into Fresno. We were stiff from hanging on and from the cold that goes with open exposure at 50 miles per hour. I could feel and hear the gravel of the train yard crunching beneath my shoes. I wasn't entirely sure where I was, and of course, thought I might be in Modesto. But the railroad detective knew exactly where I was. What made him think that two boys less than five feet tall carrying pillowcases were runaways? Then the railroad detected that the most humiliating thing I could have had done to me. She showed up at the detention center worried and relieved. She couldn't understand why I'd hopped a train when I had a pass. Since my dad had worked for the railroad, the pass was good until I was 18. I tried to explain that anybody could ride with a pass. It wasn't the first time she didn't understand me, and it wouldn't be the last. I went to high school in Bakersfield because there wasn't one in Orlando. While there, I became friends with Mildred Carr, now Mildred Copeland. Standing on the corner across from school, the three of us used to smoke and be cool, you know. We went across the street for a smoke and didn't return. We went downtown, two girls and me, each of us 14, just walking and talking and smoking. Mildred would later recall that we had five dollars among the three of us. The girls were wearing skirts, since the Bakersfield public schools didn't allow females to wear slacks in those days. How were the girls going to hop a train in skirts? I decided I'd take them to my house in Oildale on Yosemite Street and give them a pair of my pants. After spending 15 cents on bus fare, we had $4.85 remaining on our trip to Las Vegas. We had also determined that I was going to gamble and make a ton of money. And then we might use some of the proceeds to ride a passenger train home, if we came home at all. Despite the borrowed blue jeans, the girls had trouble hopping a freight train. I grabbed a freight that was moving slow, hoping that the girls would do the same. While I was looking back to see if they were going to be able to get on, I was knocked off by a switch. I finally got the girls onto a lumber car that was standing still. Since they couldn't learn how to hop, I went for the parked car. Once on board, the girls and I caught our breath for the trip northeast to Las Vegas, not knowing that the train went south to Los Angeles. We went right across the Mojave Desert, and we didn't even ride a boxcar. What kind of hobos were we, anyhow? We were out in the open on a flat car loaded with lumber. None of us had thought about how cold it would be after dark on an open, moving train car. None of us had a light jacket, and I wore only a short-sleeved cotton t-shirt. The girls wanted to sleep because they were tired and because they thought they wouldn't be as miserable. Let me lie on top of one of them, and the other one can lie on top of me. Mildred says she remembers rubbing the sleep from her eyes and seeing me walking and crawling on top of a boxcar ahead of the lumber car. There is something about moving that liberates me to this day, even though I sometimes get burnt out from all my traveling. In November 1997, a group of singers got together for a tribute to my music and me that aired on the Nashville Network. I was interviewed and asked to sum up my career in a few words. A 35-year bus ride Some folks think I was oversimplifying, but sometimes that's how I look at it. Liz Anderson wrote in 1966 as a line from I'm a Lost and Fugitive, my first number one song. I later wrote The Running Kind, a song that in essence says I've always been running for no particular reason. There is a restlessness in my soul that I've never conquered with motion or marriages. My yearning to travel is not as strong as it was when I was young. I've mellowed a lot, but it's still there to a degree, and it will be till the day I die. By nightfall, the train had pulled into the Los Angeles area. The girls stayed in the flat car while I took our pocket change to go for food. Mildred later recalled how the girls went for 15 hours without peeing. I didn't think about their discomfort at the time because I could piss in the wind and relieve myself. I returned to the flat car from a tiny grocery store where I'd bought cigarettes, Campbell beans and bacon soup, peanut butter and bologna. We ate the cold, thick soup right out of the can with our fingers. We each had a sandwich, leaving enough for a second sandwich apiece. We started walking into the night and came upon a little black car. Just a little matter of popping the hood and some hot wiring and we were on our way.",

      "content": "There were no inside car latches in those days and no alarm systems either. In our young minds, we were party goers, not criminals. I'm sure we'd have known that what we were doing was wrong if we'd have stopped to think about it. But we had stopped thinking about the time we decided to take the trip. We didn't get five miles before the stolen car ran out of gasoline. The next car we saw had a police emblem on its side. It was illegal for 15-year-olds to be on the street at 2 a.m. Luckily, the stolen car was several blocks behind us, so the police never knew I'd taken it. Mildred was put into a room, Carol was put into another room, and I was put in a cell. I decided to play hard-ass and refused to give my name. The girls gave theirs, and their names matched the missing persons report our parents had filed. You didn't have to wait three days in 1952, as you do today, to file on missing persons. Our parents drove from Bakersfield, and we were let go in our parents' custody. At 14, I was already familiar with legal terminology. Once again, I was punished for skipping school by being kept home from school. Then my mom did something that revealed her financial struggle. I didn't appreciate the significance of this story until Mildred reminded me of it in October 1998. My mother and my sister Lillian went to Carol's parents' house and then to Mildred's. At each home, Mom asked for only one thing, the pants I had loaned the girls. I'm here after my boys' pants, she told the girls' parents. Back then, a pair of Levi's, or blue jeans, cost about $3.50. My song, Mama Tried, debuted on July 27, 1968, 16 years after my escapade with the girls. The song talks about my mom's nonstop struggle as a single parent pitted against my inner restlessness. In the early 1980s, I recorded an album called For the Mama That Tried, a collection of her favorite gospel songs. I did a lot for her, but I realize now that much of it was too little, too late. For years after Dad died, neither Mama or anybody else could tell me much. Reporters and the general public have always been fascinated by my juvenile delinquency. Many have been taken by the fact that I'd been to prison. Johnny Cash had his own television show on ABC back in the 1960s. During my first appearance on it in 1968, he and I did a routine about one of his concerts inside San Quentin. Folks told me that ABC got a lot of negative mail because it had an ex-convict on primetime variety show. Can you imagine what would happen today if I were 24, just out of prison, and trying to get a record deal in Nashville? When I got my deal, the labels were looking for artists with their own style. Today's homogenized country music is produced by a bunch of artists who sound like each other. No label would take a chance on my sound, especially with my personal background, if I were trying to start over. Back in 1951, when I was 14, Bunky's drive-in restaurant was Oildale's end place. Everybody came to see and be seen, although we had all seen each other many times. Most of us were too poor and too young, or both, to afford a car. One night, I noticed a guy who, in retrospect, reminded me of Henry Fonda. I was especially intrigued with Bob Teague because he had been in the Marines for two years. When he was found out at 16, he was immediately discharged. The fact that he had military background had pulled a fast one on the government, and was 18, made me admire him somewhat. When we got to talking at Bunkies, Bob said he'd heard that I could sing like Lefty Brazell. Bob told me that he could sing like Hank Williams, a statement that only raised my opinion of him. I tried to teach myself a few chords on an old Bronson guitar that my brother had brought home from his gasoline station. The thing was beating up pretty badly with strings that were too high off its crooked neck. Bob had an Epiphone guitar that belonged to his brother, and it was beautiful. He said I could play it if I liked, and the offer also included lessons. I spent a lot of time listening to the radio and couldn't have been more complimented when he said I sang like Lefty. Lefty was my favorite, and I didn't try to imitate him. I was just gifted with something of the same sort of sound. Lefty Frazell himself, Bob said, was going to play in Bakersfield's Rainbow Garden in a couple of weeks. When the big night arrived, Bob and I rode in a borrowed car and took some beer. Before the show could begin, we got drunk and passed out on the lawn outside the garden. I wonder now why I wasn't arrested for public drunkenness. A kid my age snoring, surrounded by empty beer cans. I was shaken awake by someone shouting that we were missing the show. I looked up to see my brother-in-law, Bill Ray, someone who I admired very much. I couldn't believe a girl like her from a two-parent family in a nice neighborhood agreed to dance with the likes of me. My neighborhood's reputation was a little bit tainted, and my personal reputation was outright bad. I was lost in her feminine charms, says Janine, and I danced closely. But the spell was instantly broken when someone hollered, and now here's Lefty Frizzell. The crowd rushed to the bandstand, but I was just too short to see my idol when someone passed a chair to him. The audience in those days were very informal when they were on their best behavior and were outright dangerous when they were on their worst. Now everyone in the place, including me, old shorty, could see him. Dressed in a white western suit, Lefty's charisma made him a human magnet. But how would I know? I didn't look at anybody but Lefty. I even forgot about Janine, who may have been still on my arm. During that set, Lefty would introduce two of his classics, first being Always Late With Your Kisses, and the flip side, which was called Mom and Dad's Waltz. And I was so impressed because the song was for his mother and dad. And I remember a lump coming in my throat when he said that all the royalties from this song goes to my mother and my father. The spell that Lefty cast that night sealed my disinterest in school. One day Bob Tigg asked if I'd like to join him on a trip to visit his grandfather in San Antonio. The idea of going to Texas had always been something I'd wanted to do. Texas was the home of Lefty Frizzell, Bob Wills, and the Texas Playboys. And Texas seemed like a faraway mecca to me because of those guys. I thought we'd just run into Wills and Lefty, kind of like a lot of tourists who go to Nashville each year. They flood the city with plastic cameras and a lot of them assuming that they're going to run into Alan Jackson and Garth Brooks and the ones that don't know country music probably think they're going to see Hank Senior. Somehow there is a wholesomeness to that kind of thinking, especially these days. Bob and I left town on a Greyhound bus, but it soon got boring and we got off and began to hitchhike. Once again, I was experiencing the thrill of travel. I had my thumb in the air, concrete beneath me, and Texas in my mind's eye. I pitied the kids who were back in school trying to name the first battle of the Civil War. We got a ride with a guy who let us off in a Amarillo where Bob took me to buy some cowboy boots and a western hat. Now any man can tell you the first time he drove a car. And men more than women can remember in precise detail their first sexual experience. Bob Tigg took me to the Texas Hotel, which looked kind of drab on the outside and was decorated much like a riverboat should be. The only thing absent was the river, but I wasn't thinking about water. I'd never seen such heavily painted women or women sitting around in various stages of undress. Each time I looked at a girl, she was already looking at me. I figured I must have stood out, and I was terrified that the girls and Bob would know that this was my first time. I wasn't afraid of sex, just afraid of somebody thinking it was my first time. Hadn't I just hitchhiked halfway across the country? I remember that none of the girls wanted anything to do with me because they said I was too young. My eyes locked with those of a heavyset woman in an electric pink dress. She probably lumbered up to me, but it seemed as if she glided. The other girls were probably afraid of being charged with statutory rape. I watched in fascination as she undressed and let her clothes fall to the floor, creating a pool of pink that glowed almost as much as the blush on my face. The whole thing didn't last very long, but I'd remember it for a lifetime. Bob and I resumed our hitchhiking, determined to get to Big Springs, Texas, where we planned to knock on Lefty Prezell's door. In the modern music business, we would have been called germs. That's what people in country music call fans who go from enjoyment to worship and pester the celebrity who is the target of their affection. We were hot, tired, and dirty when our last ride dropped us off in Big Springs. I might have thought the town was the biggest collection of dumb people I'd ever seen. Believe you me, if Lefty Brazell had lived in my town, I could have told you his address and the dimensions of his lawn. But not only did Lefty not live in my town, he didn't live in Big Springs. I wondered what made Bob so certain Big Springs was left his hometown, but I don't remember asking him. I just remember the disappointment with the guy who I admired so much at the time. We resumed our journey to Grandpa Tigg's house in San Antonio, but now we'd gone through almost all of the $180 with which we had begun the trip. With the little we had left, we decided to get a room, and somehow we found work for the next morning building fences. I probably could have fallen asleep to the sound of music, but I couldn't sleep to the sound of breaking glass and busting furniture. And I'll tell you what, the heat was so damn bad in those days without air conditioning, that was the real problem. So, Bob and I overslept and we were late for our first day on the job. We were fired without ever seeing an inch of the fence. We went on to Bob's grandpa's house, where we stayed about two weeks before the old man got tired of us, and he took us down to the railroad yard, bought us a pound of bologna and gave us $5 and two loaves of bread. And he said, now, boys, you know what you do with this? And Bob and I both looked at him, said, no, grandpa. We took that good advice and hopped a train, this time en route to Los Angeles. We had wanted to hitchhike because we were bored with the rails. A motorist picked us up and soon picked up a third hitchhiker in the car. Bob showed him a gun he had bought in New Mexico, and after the guy got out, the cops detained him. An unbeknownst to us, someone had robbed a nearby liquor store. When questioned about seeing anyone suspicious, the hitchhiker told the cops about Bob and me and the gun. Bob and I were standing by the road with our thumbs outraged. I don't recall which of us saw the first squad car, but suddenly it began raining policemen. One hit me with a blackjack and my head throbbed as I was thrown into a back of a police car. Bob and I watched the rear window as the cops emptied our suitcases along the highway. If we'd hitched one more ride, we'd have avoided all this. One of the cops yelled, I found it, as Bob's pistol fell out of the suitcase and onto the pavement. And it was the first time, but it wouldn't be the last. If you were to look at my rap sheet, you'd find that we'd been arrested for strong-arm robbery. Not suspicion of strong-arm robbery, but strong-arm robbery. Bob and I stayed in jail for five days, and it seemed like a full year. The charges against us were dropped, and we were released. I wish the cops that had taken us in had been the ones who'd let us go, but it didn't happen that way. The jailer who said we were free didn't even apologize. We got out of jail at about 5 o'clock in the afternoon. They fed twice a day, and they let us out just before chow time. And Bob and I had a total of 16 cents in our pocket. And we walked from Lincoln Heights all the way to San Fernando, and I've gauged it since then. We got out there about 2 o'clock in the morning, and we saw this donut truck delivering pastry. And we went up, and we bought 16 cents worth of yesterday's donuts from this guy, and ate every one of them, and we threw up in about 20 minutes. And then we made our way on to Oildale, where my mother was waiting for me and wondering where I'd been. We walked from the highway to my mom's house, where mom told us both over and over how glad she was we were home. I kept waiting for her scolding for taking off, but it never came. Maybe she was kind, simply because she was glad I was safe. Or maybe she was beginning to realize that nothing she could say or do would do any good. I was going to come and go as I pleased, so she fussed over me and made me breakfast. A person doesn't always remember what they ate when they were 14 years old, but I remember eating a half a dozen eggs and a side of bacon and about a half a loaf of bread and some peanut butter and syrup to fill the platter that morning. When school started up again, I attended class for nine days, then I stopped going. The truant officer again hauled me off to the juvenile hall. I didn't like it there any more than I liked school. The only place I wanted to be was anywhere except where I was. So once again, six years before reaching 21, I took off. Went to work for a couple named Slim Rayford and his wife. Trouble was, we did a week's worth of work about every two days. We bucked hay from 7 o'clock in the morning to 10 in the evening, five days a week. We earned a dollar and a quarter an hour, plus a room and our food. I thought about returning to school or juvenile hall, but not for long. The fact that I was willing to do such back-breaking work rather than attend class should give you an idea of how much I hated school. As I told you, we worked for a man named Slim Rayford. So we went out to this old beer joint called the Fun Center, which we'd heard featured country music. There was just an old guitar and a microphone sitting over in the corner. On our way to the place, Bob and I pulled some money and bought an old guitar that cost five dollars. Nobody was going to mistake it for a Martin D-45, I'll tell you that. But our guitar wasn't nearly as bad as the one inside the fun center. It looked as if it had been beaten harder than some of the customers. This was a knife and gun club, where both sometimes yielded to a wooden bat kept under the bar. The joint was filled with people that looked like they didn't hold a job at anything. They were pretty good at setting up the bar and drinking beer. The place had concrete floors and it had concrete block walls and bar stools with uneven legs. Bob and I walked in and I had this guitar strapped on my back. Before long, a customer asked me if I could play it. We began to look around, and sure enough, you could hook it up and play it, make it work. Bob followed with Hank Williams' You're Cheatin' Heart. Those songs were the predictable part of our repertoire. I've played for dead audiences in my life, although not for very long, if I could manage it. They were more lifeless than delegates to a mortician's convention. Four songs into our set, we could tell that the people were paying attention and enjoying what we were doing. Then the bartender offered us $5 to play for the rest of the night. Before we could say yes, he threw in all the free beer we could drink. I didn't even have to spend my paycheck to get drunk, because the drunk was free. I'll remember that job forever, one of the most thrilling experiences of my life. People who don't play music have no idea how great it feels to play it right. To play it right while getting paid is the all-time natural high. After Bob and I finished out the hay season, I returned to Oildale as I always did. School had long been underway, and I suppose I could have enrolled. But I didn't bother starting something I knew I'd quit. So in no time, I was grabbed again by the truant officer. The place had become my second home to such an extent that I kept my phonograph records there. I even spent my 14th birthday locked up in Juvenile Hall. My mother came on Christmas Day with a Martin guitar. Soon I was planning what would be my first escape with one of my buddies. We were being held in what was called the New Juvenile Hall. And because I had no prior record of running at the time, they didn't mind putting us in there when it was incomplete. Some of the things, like bars over the windows, hadn't been done yet. So we found this window that was made up of chicken wire that was sandwiched between two pieces of glass. And while the ping pong games and the different things people were doing in the day room was going on, my friend and I grabbed this big bench, and we made a run at that chicken wire, and it run all the way through. He and I had both been in tumbling classes in the 6th, 7th, and 8th grades, so we did our tumbling act. Out the window, on the sidewalk, perfect rolls, up on our feet. We ran about 400 yards, roughly the length of four football fields, actually, to a chain-link fence surrounding the facility. Every time I turned around, I saw lights flickering on, and I could see people running after me. I rested on top of the fence, and it cut the front of my shirt and into my skin, and I carried a scar for many years. Then I jumped off the other side of the fence, and I fell about what I thought was about 25 feet. The school ground was about 12 feet, but someone had dug a hole on the other side, and I fell into some mud, just like in a bad dream. I finally made my way out of it, but I was safe and unharmed. And me and my friend made our way to what was known as China Grade Loop Bluff. Off the cliff, we stumbled and we fell and finally made our way to the bottom, which led us to the edge of Kern River. Kern River in this particular area was only about a foot, maybe two feet deep, and was awfully wide, and we figured, quite shallow. As we tried to make our way across the river that night, we fell in many holes we had to swim out of. I think maybe that's where the song Kern River may have come from in some way. After crossing the river, Bobby Cox went home to his family and I went home to mine and it wasn't long before they came and took us both back. And then they sent me to what was the same as a road camp for men, but it was called Camp Owens, and it was sort of a road camp-like deal where you dug ditches during the day and you slept at night, and if you did anything else, they'd beat the shit out of you. And me and another kid named Bobby, not the same Bobby, left that joint and got us a 1949 Lincoln in a little town in the mountains there and made our way down the Kern Canyon. And we were speeding out the canyon and stopped on the side of the road. And I went around to the back bumper, and sure enough, here come some lights. It was a carload of women, and they pulled right up to me and honked their horns and blinked their lights while I got my clothes up and scurried back into the car. If you drive over the speed limit enough, you're eventually going to get arrested. If you commit adultery enough, you'll eventually be found out and divorced by your spouse. If you're threatened enough about the consequences of fleeing juvenile hall, ultimately the threats will be made good. In February 1952, less than two months after my 15th birthday, I was remanded to the custody of the California Youth Authority, CYA, for 18 months. I was one of 20 new inmates, and that's what I was, because I was no longer the ward of the school system. New inmates would lodge in one of nine cottages, each of which was named after a U.S. The cottage supervisor's skin was wrinkled enough that he could have held a playing card between the wrinkles. The other inductees named him Pruneface because his face did look like a prune. And it was very well built because he lifted weights. What a pathetic life he led, spending each day overseeing the lives of boys he hated but never bothered to get to know. We new inmates stood in formation as Pruneface walked among us like a drill instructor. He stopped directly in front of me and looked me up and down. And he stood so close to me that I could smell his breath. He bent his beefy middle finger and punched me in the chest, right above my breastbone. My uniform bore a patch where he liked to hit people. The patch was his target, he said, because it enabled him to hit people right where it hurt the most. Pruneface punched me several times, but I didn't flinch. Pruneface had no idea I was listening to his ranting without hearing a thing. I was already thinking about how I was going to get out. I wanted to do a visual survey of the place, but I knew he'd knock me to the ground if I as much as looked one way or the other. I was supposed to stare directly in front of me, but not make eye contact with him. Anyone who's ever stood in the military formation knows what I mean. I attempted four escapes, an average of one every four and a half months. One I made to the fence, one I made over the fence, and one I made all the way to my house in Bakersfield. Even though it was much harder to break out of California's penal institution than it was Oildale's school district, I somehow handled the job. Nella's school that I saw firsthand how men of authority arbitrarily beat their subjects. He would inspect the making of our beds every morning after getting out of bed. There was no bell, no siren, no trumpet, just the lights came on. And you had those five minutes to get your bed made and get yourself at attention and look straight ahead. We stood in detention, and he would check our nightgowns to see if they were hanging correctly. And he had on boots with taps, and I can remember he walked always from behind us, where you couldn't see what he was going to do and who he was going to slap next. But I remember this one morning, I was standing in detention, and I must have moved my head a slight bit, because he hit me upside the head and slapped me over a bunk, and I fell in the floor. Although I was assigned to Lincoln Cottage, I didn't spend much time there. I never asked when President Disciplinary held office. I took seven buddies on my first attempt at escape from the Disciplinary Cottage. We were working in the Nellis yard, which meant the only thing between freedom and us was a 12-foot chain-link fence.",

      "content": "We decided which guy would give the command, and he did. I made it all the way to the top, but somebody got a hold of my foot, and that was the end of that one. I was one of four boys sent to the sadistic guard for punishment. Running on blacktop hurts your legs and aches more than running on dirt. He ran us till we dropped, then kicked us to our feet and made us run some more. I was suffering from exhaustion and sliding inside my boots, because my boots, you see, were size 11 and I wear a size 7. The inside of my boots were soaked with sweat and blood. So when the blisters popped, my raw flesh was rubbed against wet leather. The only thing holding my shoes to my feet were the laces that had been wrapped around my legs. By now the laces were cutting into the skin, and I was sure blood was running down my legs. I couldn't stop to see how serious I might be bleeding, so against my better judgment, I told him. Keep running, you little bastard, was the only reply, screamed directly in my ear. After about three and a half hours, I simply stopped. He stared at me in disbelief, and I replayed my words in my mind, also in disbelief. Then he smirked at me and assured me that I would run some more. He began beating me from behind with a rake, nearly knocking me down. I thought about letting myself collapse, but I didn't want to be on the ground so that he could swing vertically at me with that thing. Run, you little bastard, he yelled, running beside me and beating me endlessly with that rake. I could still buy my clothes in the boys' department. And this maniac was going to beat me and run me to my death. I hesitate to call them inmates, but that's what they were. The place was overrun with groups that were more like gangs. The Mexicans, the blacks, drug dealers, other groups that hung out together. The whites never stuck together and never stuck up for anybody that was white. Prisons and other places of confinement are very clannish, except for the whites. I belonged to no one's group, and therefore I was a setting target for all of them. I got the hell beat out of me on the football field by 15 Mexicans. The reason I know there was 15, because that's how many was in the company. Talking after lights were turned out was prohibited. Nonetheless, I was whispering to a kid in the bunk next to mine one night before I drifted off to sleep. My hand touched the floor, and I was awakened by the feel of something sticky on my fingers. I became fully conscious about the time someone landed his knees squarely in my back. The sticky stuff was blood of the kid to whom I'd been talking. The knee belonged to his assailant, who had stabbed the boy many times. Out of pure instinct, I straightened my back out so quick that it threw the guy completely off of me and over a bunk or two. Back when I was doing time, there's a night I can't forget. A madman with a knife in hand tried to kill me while I slept. I wrote those words years later as the opening to Mama's Prayers, a song about how Mama's pleading with God repeatedly saved my life. There's no other explanation for my having survived so many near-death experiences. That night at Nellis, I leapt from my bed and pulled the blanket with me. I held it at arm's length between me and the black guy with a knife. My buddy was still in a puddle of blood, lying on the floor. The crazed black man kept stabbing and slashing the blanket. Otherwise, he would have stripped the blanket from my hands, given himself an open and probably a fatal shot at me. We were locked inside of a cage, a wire cage, with a catwalk on the outside for the guards to watch us through. For 45 minutes, I kept this man at bay, till finally someone came with a key and got in there and got him, and got him off of me. He eventually died in the gas chamber at San Quentin for killing a man. I was almost sliced to death with a knife before I was old enough to own a shaving razor. I've headlined in Las Vegas and the world's largest concert halls. And I can't count the times I've appeared on primetime television. I've often wondered if some of the heads of state who graciously received me would have done so if they'd have known about my lawless past. I'd escaped from juvenile halls, I'd escaped from Fred C. Nellis' school, and I'd escaped from just about everywhere I'd been, Camp Owens, simply because I didn't believe that I deserved to be there. I also couldn't stand the confinement and being told what to do, and I didn't like the way they treated the boys. Another reason was I thought if I stayed there, I would surely die there. Years later, when I saw Paul Newman in Cool Hand Luke, I thought, you know, some of that reminds me of my young life. Newman's character escaped his work detail on the road gang by blending in with others and simply walking away. He didn't make the mistake I'd made at Nellis of sprinting openly for the fence. One day, when the other residents and I were working this field, I too simply walked away. The guard didn't notice me because he was focused on a herd of bodies. I slowly ambled fifty yards from his viewpoint, then a hundred. By that time, I could drop to my knees and let the other workers pass me. Once I was safely out of his sight, I ran like hell and didn't stop until I was several miles from Nellis. I quickly stole an old 1937 Ford, and I made my way after hours of being lost in Los Angeles and not knowing where I was at, somehow wound up in a town called Indio. My absence had been noticed, and the California Highway Patrol had been alerted. And I made a mistake by trying to bury myself in the basement of a packing shed. I knew the cops would come for me, but I didn't expect a posse. So I decided to hide myself and do a good job of it. I buried myself alive, leaving little more than my nostrils above the ground. When I woke to the sound of angry voices, they belonged to the cops I had expected. Searching for me with flashlights were about 20 vigilantes, furious men who were determined to take the law and the lawless into their own hands. I've already told you about once being picked up and jailed for five days for robbery that I didn't commit. This time, I was sought for rape and murder that I didn't commit. The vigilantes had been told that a man fitting my description had been seen by a highway patrolman fleeing towards the shed. I heard one of the men say they were bound to catch me. When the self-appointed posse walked away, never seeing me, tucked far underneath the shed and dirt, I bolted for the highway. Can you believe that I, a repeat runaway, thought I was lucky in finding a highway patrolman? He made one pass on the road, saw me, and I knew he was going to turn around. When I told the officer that I was the escapee from Nellis that he was looking for, he stared at me with disbelief. He told me in great detail about the rape and the murder of 48 hours ago. He read me the description of the suspect, and it sounded like a verbal portrait of me. He was aware of the vigilantes, who were the victims' father, brothers, and neighbors. This neat highway patrol guy said, you know, you're really a lucky boy. I said, what guy? And he said, the guy that they were looking for looked just like you. And they found him just minutes or about an hour ago, in fact, and made a positive identification. You know, if they'd have caught you a while ago, they'd have killed you. It was then the officer rolled down his window, probably so he wouldn't smell me, as we rode silently back to Nellis. Before I turned 16, I was transferred to Preston School of Industry. It was a higher security facility, after which residents were supposed to get vocational training. Perhaps they thought they were training me to be a milkman. Preston was made of solid brick, and it had more guards than Nellis. And it was definitely more secure, and it took me about, oh, I think six months to escape. You hear a lot these days about how America has lost its innocence. They're always comparing the country with the way it rallied behind the troops during World War II and how it rallied again during the Korean conflict. I've heard people say that back in the 50s we didn't even have to lock our doors. I've heard people say why we didn't even take our keys out of our cars. Preston School of Industry was situated near Ion, California. Not exactly a thriving metropolis, right? It was small-town America. Straight out of Jimmy Stewart's It's a Wonderful Life. About 4 a.m., I was walking in its squeaky-clean streets, lined with wood-framed houses whose residents were fast asleep. In minutes, the milkmen and the paperboys would come along. I walked into a yard and saw a car with windows down and reached inside for the ignition. Neighbors, I thought, it's really nice to be among trusting folks like you. I eased into the car with my PSI escapee buddy, Rick. We didn't even close the door so as to ensure our silence. I started the engine slowly, released the clutch, and probably attained a getaway speed of five miles per hour. The car jolted to a stop, so suddenly I almost went through the windshield. The owner had used a log chain to tie the axle to a towering oak. He feared PSI escapees might try to steal his vehicle. What kind of trust is that? It was getting so nobody believed in anybody. And why the log chain? Was he trying to anchor his car to the tree or the tree to the car? The noise awakened the guy inside, who of course called the cops. Rick and I lay under the man's house all day and chuckled at the parade of squad cars. For the first time in my criminal career to become worthy of a helicopter. My breakout prompted more activity there in that little town than they'd seen in years. Late that afternoon, the man at the house walked outdoors. The second man asked the homeowner where he thought the escapees might be. They were the feet of a kid so short I could see a toy pistol strapped to his waist. He kept nagging his dad about where the escaped bad boys might be hiding. His dad kept blowing him off and finally became annoyed. He told the kid to be quiet because, for all he knew, the bad boys were hiding right underneath the house and might jump out and grab him. Would you believe? The kid took his old man seriously. The kid got on his hands and knees and crawled under the house with his pistol. When his eyes met ours, I think all three of us peed our pants. He screamed and the grown-ups rallied, and my pal and I crawled out from under the house with our hands in the air. The only gun trained on us was made out of plastic and loaded with paper caps. But we couldn't have outrun the posse of neighbors that instantly assembled. In those days, people spent a lot of time in the yards. I've already told you about my first sexual experience that was purely sex and was a whole lot better for me, I'm sure, than it was for her. I think it's time I tell you about the first time I made love. They had so many guards watching me that the other inmates could have juggled straight razors and no one would have noticed. Although, some years later, I had a great infatuation with her. I even wrote a song for her called, Always Wanting You. Actually, I wrote two songs that morning, somewhere between 3 and 4 a.m. And I called her to sing both of them, to her, in person. And it was, I guess, February 15th, 1974, the tune, Always Wanting You, went to number one. The sleeper person who was answering the phone said Dolly was asleep. She said, well, she's way down underneath the cover. I said, well, go way down underneath the cover and get her out. Anyhow, back to my first dolly, whose last name I won't reveal. I may have taken her virginity, and her eventual husband may think the same thing. Virginity was a precious gift for a woman to give to a man in 1953. Dolly was not exactly well-behaved in any area of her life. Mostly, youngsters back then met in school or church. I'd been discharged from PSI, Preston School of Industry, and was back in my hometown in Oildale. In the spring of the year, I could work in the potatoes, and they were everywhere around Bakersfield. I was working in the shed and was making a real good check for a boy 16 years old. I got off work on Friday and had to ride a city bus from Oildale to the east side of Bakersfield, where the processing potato sheds were situated along the railroad track at an area that was known as Edison Highway. On the bus, I spotted a girl I'd known from detention hall. She and I had made eyes at each other, never thinking we'd ever touch, because she was on the girls' side and I was on the boys', and there was bars in between. We felt it inside detention hall, and sure enough, we had run smack into each other. She said she'd also just got off work at Tiny's Waffle Shop, and she said she had some money and wanted to live her life on her own. How would you like to go to, say, Eugene, Oregon or someplace? That would be nice, she said. She told me that the train left Bakersfield at 1 a.m. She thought we could get to the station in time to buy a ticket. She looked like a combination of Julia Roberts and Cher. Dolly and I got on the train, and that was my first time to really make love to a woman. It was a 22-hour ride, and we made love the majority of the 22 hours. And we got off, and we got off, and finally got off at Eugene. We had no idea what we was going to do for a living. Sure enough, there was another tiny's waffle shop that was hooked up to a chain that went all the way through Oregon, Washington, and California. She went back to work for them and I went to work at a produce house unloading bananas. I don't remember anything bad about our relationship except that Dolly and I got along so well that the slightest little thing set me off. He mistook that for the fact that I might be gay, too. I've never discriminated against anybody, and I never hated blacks, Mexicans, or Chinese, or anybody else. Although, I've come to despise attorneys, but they earned it. This guy who mistook my demeanor invited me to supper. Dolly had a key to the house, and I didn't, and couldn't get inside. Our neighbor offered me some supper while I waited for Dolly to come home from work. I set my lunch pail in front of the door so Dolly would know that I was home. And I sat down and he filled up my glass with some wine. And I drank the first glass fast because I was thirsty. As he came down with the glass, his beard touched me from behind. What happened next was so quick that I don't remember exactly how it occurred. He went up against this ice box and withered down to the floor. About that time, I stormed out of his house as Dolly was coming up to the porch. I told her, and she acted as if she wanted to check out my story. I always took immediate offense to that, and I'm still that way. If somebody doesn't believe me, it really bothers me. So I ask her, you don't believe me, do you? Not really. I walked over to the ironing board and started taking money out of my pockets. Well, I haven't seen her to this day, and I don't know whether she's dead or alive. I wish she'd come forward and contact some of my people, let me know. I walked out of our duplex apartment onto what was a main boulevard in Eugene, and I could see a freight train slowly crossing about three blocks away. And it was heading the right direction, so I took off running. Sure enough, I got there and was able to grab a gondola. But that was really cold, and we were climbing into the mountains. We stopped somewhere for a moment, and I got off and climbed up into this reefer. I say we because it was me and a couple other hobos. Let me tell you, it was some ride over the mountains that night. It was there that I jumped off and hopped another train, headed south. In fact, I did it the other day just to make sure I could. Once you learn how to do it, you pretty much remember the main things. I pulled myself into an open boxcar and let my eyes adjust to the light. And I wanted to ask, well, why aren't you at work? But I had better sense and better manners. I had long ago learned to respect my elders, especially those who were on the bum and needed help. One of the men that appeared to be the eldest kind of grinned and tossed a pouch of tobacco and some rolling papers across the floor to me. When I looked into his face, my eyes locked with some of the kindest eyes I'd ever seen. They glowed, they smiled, and they were all-knowing. His eyes looked as if they'd seen it all, pools of a poor man's wisdom. The men continued their small talk, which was mostly directed at me. Someone so young riding the rails, I'm sure they thought I was wasting my life, because most of them had done the same thing when they were my age. I made a comment to one of the men that I was hungry, that I intended to rob one of those food cars as soon as this train stopped. And almost in unison, the hobos barked at me not to break the seal on any food car. They didn't particularly care about my height, but they didn't want a railroad detective coming down on them. In those days, railroad dicks sometimes looked the other way if a transit rode the rails without breaking any laws. But if you broke into a car with a seal on it, they'd come down on you. I jumped out and walked across only a few cars when I came to the one I wanted, Mark Food. Down the ladder, to the ground, and over to the door. Inside, loaded with canned foods, one lone case of green beans sat on top of the entire stack of a perfectly fitted boxcar. I saw it, grabbed it, and was about to leave when I seen the shadow of a man walking on top. I said, oh my God, it's a railroad detective, sure as the world. And he yelled out, he said, close that damn door when you come out of there. I closed the door and left with my case of green beans. I ran back to the boxcar and threw it up inside, and those hobos had a fit. One threatened to whip my ass, and he said, you know, we could all go to the penitentiary on account of you. Then one of the old men, who had been speechless, held up his hand like an aged Indian tribal leader. He said, open up them beans, son, as he threw me an old rusty can opener. But now you're probably wondering if I ever did anything except travel illegally or run from the law as a young man. Well, I did work for a living, and I did some other things, but I set myself in motion at 10, and I've been moving ever since. Back to the trip with a boxcar filled with green beans. It was almost daylight when I saw a distant sign that said Dunsmire and Greyhound Bus Station. Once inside, I found out that it was a mountain town called Dunsmire, California, just south of Oregon. With only 25 cents, I decided it'd have to do with just coffee. A kind waitress who looked as if she'd eaten plenty of meals refused to take my money. I asked for change for a quarter, and she gave me five nickels. I could call home, collect the 10 cents, and I did just that, knowing that Mom would be cooking breakfast, too. Mom accepted the call and wired some money to the Western Union. Soon, I had myself a clean T-shirt and a new pair of Levi's and a ticket to Bakersfield. I remember the sound of nickels dropping into the telephone and the sound of Mama's voice. As hungry and as far away as I was, I remember even more a jukebox, dropping two nickels into it, and playing Hey Good Lookin' by Hank Williams. I had a musical idol in my ear, my mother on the line, an arrangement to get home, and five cents to my name. It all meant one more first chance for Merle Haggard. I don't think there's much point in telling more stories about my illicit travels. There was plenty more trips, just different places and different faces, but for the same reason, the inner restlessness. I tried to flee, but it always awaited me when I arrived. I had a lot of fun, and I was too young to realize the price I was having to pay for it. Most people in my generation can tell you exactly where they were the day John F. Kennedy was shot, the day man first walked on the moon, and the day Elvis died. Many can also tell you the first time they ever saw a telephone or a television. The two inventions that transformed the 20th century life more than anything else, including computers. My recollection of where I first saw television is as boring as anybody else's. I'm much more excited about what I saw on television. I'd heard it on the radio and in the dives that I was often too young to enter. And I'd played it for small and often captive audiences. Right there in Bakersfield, I could watch the Billy Myers Show on Channel 29, the first television station in the San Joaquin Valley. Lewis Talley had a local television show, and I watched all the shows, Lewis Talley's, Billy Myers', Buck Owens' shows, as well as Cousin Herb Henson's shows. It never dawned on me that every town with a television station had their own local talent, the way every town with a radio station featured live entertainment in the 1920s through the 1950s. Even the Grand Ole Opry, the world's longest running live radio show, started out as a local broadcast over WSM radio in 1926. In Bakersfield, Louis was indisputably the biggest star. I mean, the guy had his own television show, a record company, a music publishing company, and he had a lot of knowledge and common sense for a man as young as he was. Of course, most of those entities didn't reach much beyond Bakersfield.",

      "content": "I'll never forget the first time I met the two of them. I'd hung around some of the dance halls in the area, places like Hurry Back Inn and The Blackboard and Lucky Spot, and then there was a place called Doc's Club, I think. And although I was too young, I'd slip in and watch these guys play. It increased my thirst to be part of this art that was called beer joint music at the time, not country music. When I came up in the business, we were required to play almost every kind of music. We had to know the difference between 1940 music and 1950 music. Unless you were capable of playing all of that kind of music, you just didn't work in Bakersfield, because those clubs were full of really good bands. So I got my courage together, and I went to Lewis Talley's studio to play my songs. Then he played them for Fuzzy, who dampened my spirits. He said I sounded too much like Win Stewart or Lefty Frizzell, and pointed out that the world already had both of those boys. He would say, you know, the first time you heard Merle Haggard, you said he sounded too much like Win Stewart, Electric Frizzell, until you owned all the company. I knew that something was wrong when you said you didn't like his singing. Then, right after that, all I heard about from you was Merle Haggard. My timing for pitching myself as a country artist wasn't at its best. From Lewis and Fuzzy, I'd gotten a listen and a warning from Lewis that Fuzzy was probably right. I did sound too much like those other artists back then. He told me that perhaps we could go do some business in the future, but not today. And I interpreted that to mean that one day I might be on Tally Record label, and time would prove me right. I continued to watch local television and country music. There was an up-and-coming artist named Buck Owens who dominated country music from the late 50s throughout the 1970s in a way that few artists ever have. But in 1952, Buck was a local star in Bakersfield, along with his pretty wife, Bonnie. I'd eventually marry Bonnie myself, but not before marrying another woman first. Bonnie's a fine harmony singer, and she's still part of my show today. Bakersfield was getting quite a reputation for great music. And folks who visited California often stopped by the town's honky-tonks just to hear the music. I played guitar as much as I could in various Bakersfield joints and sang as much as they'd make me. Jack called me from Springfield and told me that he'd give me a job, $50 a week, playing guitar and singing on his radio show. Now, I'd never been any farther east than the trip to Texas. He said he'd send me the fare for a bus ticket to Springfield, Missouri, to be part of his show. Now, I'd never worked that far east before, and I hated the trip. And I soon hated my stay, so I didn't stay too long. I quit after three weeks as a featured singer and guitarist. After 21 days, I was frowning because smiling Jack Tyree hadn't paid me a dime. I marched into Jack's office to give him my resignation and collect my money. I asked him for it, and he said, I'd like to pay you, but I just don't have the money right now. To this day, I haven't figured out why some promoters and others think that paying a musician is optional. They think it's necessary to pay the doctor and their electric bill, but a musician? Hey, let him wait for his money or stiff him. Today, Fuzzy Owen, my personal manager, collects my money. We don't even drive to the date unless we've been paid half the fee in advance. Once we arrive, the promoter often wants us to do the show, saying he can pay us after he's counted the receipts. We played Colorado City, Colorado in October 1998, and we were supposed to be paid a percentage of every ticket that was sold. Then Fuzzy noticed that the promoter had put at least 300 folding chairs in front of the people who had paid for front row seats. The front row people were pissed because they couldn't see, and I was unhappy because the promoter tried to stiff me out of money from seats he wasn't even supposed to sell. Fuzzy bugged him throughout the program and we eventually got our money. And I still have to fight occasionally to get my performance fee. There isn't a singer in the entire country music industry who can't tell story after story about all the outrageous things he had to go through, including fistfights, gunplay, just to get money owed to him. I was more than 1,500 miles from home, broke, and had no funds to get home. I don't remember how I discovered the location of Smiling Jack's petty cash, but I walked to his desk. Then I raised his trouser leg and pulled the water bills from his sock. He said, I'll have you arrested before you get to the city limits. I rode a Greyhound to Bakersfield, not knowing what my future held and certainly not knowing that one day I'd climb aboard a bus and still be riding in 1999. I'd married a woman there two years earlier when I was only 17. That meant we were cruising Main Street while looking at the girls between stopping for Cokes or sneaking into the back of a beer joint. I was 17 and driving a car that I'd bought with a down payment and my mom's co-signature. Leona Hobbs and her sister Alice were 15 and 13, respectively. They didn't look it, especially Alice, who was fully developed, I imagine, by the time she was 12. I wouldn't have thought those girls were sisters because they didn't look alike. When they told me they were sisters, I thought they were lying. Alice looked like Laura McCall, and Leona was a gorgeous lady when she was young, but Alice was beautiful. I asked the girls, I said, hey, would you like to have a hamburger? and said, yeah, I'd like to have two. I don't know if I got enough money for everybody to have two hamburgers. Are you the only one that wants two? We got into a little tiff right there. Leon and I hit it off because we were so wrong for each other. The challenge was on both sides of the road, you know? She wasn't one to walk away from a challenge, and I wasn't either. We started arguing right from the beginning, and we argued right up until the time that we saw each other leave. The most recent time I spoke to her, and here I am in my 60s, she said she hated me. Leona and I eventually moved in with my brother Lowell and his wife. Couples live together freely today, but in 1956, couples who shacked up were looked down upon, at least by my family. I didn't care what anybody thought about me, and I know that Leona didn't care what anybody thought about her. With all of my confinements and all the times I'd run away since my dad had died nine years ago, I figured that I owed my mom no more pain. If it hadn't been for Mama's shame, I might never have married Leona Hobbs. I just mentioned to Lowell that it might be a good idea if Leona and I got married. She was, in fact, overhearing a conversation about her, not one directed to her. I asked Lola, I said, can you take me and Leona to Reno, where we can get a quick wedding, the way you can do even today in Nevada? There's a place in Las Vegas today that is a drive-through wedding chapel. You can drive through and order a marriage license and be pronounced man and wife without even getting out of your car. Lowell and his wife Fran drove us to Reno and were our witnesses in a tiny chapel. I worked in the cotton fields, and I shared what I made with Leona's 11 brothers and sisters and her father and mother. I worked in the oil fields, too, and music was something we did when we had the time. The great Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys came to an end in 1949 when Tommy Duncan left and went on his own. Tommy Duncan, the former lead singer for Bob Wills, was playing in Hanford, California in 1956. Will Ray put together a band and called and asked me if I'd like to play lead guitar. Being asked to play behind this legend and one of my true idols remains one of my greatest professional thrills to this day. Since that time, I've met presidents, three or four of them. I met John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart, but nothing was like the thrill of meeting Tommy Duncan. There was about 13 musicians in this band that Will Ray had thrown together. There was, like, accordion players and eight-string mandolin players and things that just did not work for a swing band. And after he'd finished Deep Water, he walked over to me and he said, well, sort of low, he said, it looks like we've got it to ourselves. Would you mind sort of kicking these songs off for me? His demeanor and the way he complimented me in that request inspires me even today. If my career had stopped right there, I think I would have wound up with an eternal lump in my throat. Leon Copeland, his wife Mildred, Leona, and myself went to play music with Tommy Duncan. After having seen Tommy with Wills, such an outstanding band like the Texas Playboys, it was a heartbreaker to see him with the likes of what we played with that night in Hanford. I know old Will Ray did his best, but the mandolin players and too many guitarists and everybody playing the same thing, no bass, no drummer, and of course no brass and no fiddles, it just wasn't good enough for Tommy. To top it off, Tommy was playing a big room that was capable of probably holding about 1,500, maybe 2,000 people. And all that was present was about 75, maybe 100 in the audience. Tommy deserved a whole lot more than to have to sing with all those bad players. So I was distant and thoughtful as I drove Leon's car home that night. Leona, sitting in front next to me, noticed my silence. If a woman isn't in the mood to make love, a man is wasting his time, no matter what he tries. In the same way, when a man doesn't want to talk, he doesn't want to talk. No amount of probing from a woman is going to make it happen. I wanted to be left alone, because I was quite disturbed over the lack of crowd that Tommy was able to draw. What's the matter with you? Why don't you talk? Well, I'm just sort of going over the evening, and I'm let down that Tommy didn't have no more people than he did. She said, well, if the son of a bitch could sing, he'd had a bigger crowd. I don't advocate domestic violence, but that night in 1956, without even looking up from the highway, I drew back to backhand her, and she reached for the handle of the car door, opened it, and leaped out at 50 miles an hour. When I saw her bouncing like a rubber ball, I figured it was all over. Till that point, I was convinced that there was nothing this woman could do to amaze me. I was trying to check her for broken bones, but I couldn't hold her still because she was jumping around the highway, waving the skirt of her dress that she claimed I had torn because she had jumped out of the car. Maybe I just wanted to see what made somebody behave the way she did. We're all creatures of habit, and I was no exception. In 1957, I was 20 years old, and I'd first run away from home 10 years earlier. In other words, before two decades could pass in my life, I had spent half of it running away or behind bars or in one. I'm convinced I would have been a habitual criminal and would have had a short career. I would have gotten a life sentence early in life and probably died young if music and the good Lord hadn't saved me. Before my daughter Dana turned one and I turned 21, I was back behind bars. I had rented a trailer and had a couple of guys hired, and was in the process of buying junk, finding junk, and selling junk. I'd go down into the hills of Bakersfield and was looking for things that people had thrown away. And we found this deposit of scrap iron, including motor blocks and frames and things of that nature, and we were in the process of loading them up and taking them to the junkyard and selling them. and we'd been there for three days in the sunlight, daytime, doing this, when all of a sudden the highway patrol showed up on top of the hill. They zoomed down on us, threw down on us with guns, and me and Claude Reed, and I forget the other boy's name, put our hands up. What's the matter? You guys are stealing this man's stuff. And I said, pardon me? I said, I've been here for three days. And I said, we've been working real hard and trying to stay out of trouble. I said, does it look like we're trying to steal something out here in the middle of the day? And I said, you got no fences? You got no signs? And the police officer stopped and looked at the man and said, that's right. You don't have any fences and you don't have any signs. How would anybody know you wanted this stuff? And the man's reply was, I don't have to have any fences, and I don't have to have any signs. That stuff belongs to me, and I want these boys arrested.\" And the man was right, I guess. And the cop said, well, we got no alternative, boys. And we did, and they sent us to three months in road camp. And I faded into the landscape, and then I ran like hell. I'd planned to escape, and now that I was on the lam, I realized that I hadn't planned where to go. I knew the cops would expect me to go straight to my wife and baby. I was guilty of escaping from jail and abandoning my new baby. I was born the running kind, with leaving always on my mind. I still can't believe the man who today occupies my body is the person that I used to be. I came back through Bakersfield and caught a ride with a man who was a Jehovah Witness. And he was on his way to working the sawmills up north, and I thought, boy, that's just the place for me. I was 18 years old, and he had a family, and he needed some help. I went to Eureka, or rather Arcata, California, right next to Eureka, and got a job in a plywood mill. They came in with handcuffs right in front of the rest of the workers and arrested me, and they all stood there with their mouths open wondering what I'd done. because my mother came and begged the sheriff to let me out early because I had a job. I hadn't been out of jail very long when Leona announced that she was pregnant again. That's the most polite way I can find to say that I was miserable. I wasn't ready for marriage, much less fatherhood, then more fatherhood. I heard about an oil boom in New Mexico, and I knew they'd be hiring hands. My old friends Bob Tigg and Dean Holloway and I agreed that we should go and try to get us a job. Geology wasn't as sophisticated then, and no one knew how long an oil boom would last. So Dean, Bob, and I took off for New Mexico, and I told Leona I'd send her some money for the babies just as soon as I made some, and told her there were no way I could make any money in Bakersfield. She got mad, of course, but I think she secretly understood that with my reputation and work history, there was not exactly a surplus of employers who wanted to hire me in my hometown. I needed some seed money to get to New Mexico so I could make some money to send to my family, and I needed it quickly. Desperate men do desperate things, and they do familiar things. About three months earlier, I'd been fired from a Shell gasoline station for something I didn't do. The entire place was secured by one lock, one big padlock. So I went down to the hardware store, and I bought a padlock. And I went down to the station, bought some gas, and while the old boy was filling me up, I went around to where the padlock goes on, and I took his off and put mine on. I kept his, and that night, at ten o'clock, when everything closed, I showed up at ten minutes after ten, unlocked my lock, went inside, and while I was in there, the door shaker came by, and he saw me, and I waved at him. He waved at me, and I reached into the safe that they left open, because it was only about $150 in there that they left for the business. I took that money, went back out, and locked his lock back on, taking my lock with me. The next morning, when they came in, they fired the guy who had lied about me. Dean had a brand new 57 Pontiac because he'd been working in the oil fields, and all we needed was the money to get to New Mexico. When we got to New Mexico, the oil field was still producing, but there were thousands of people there waiting for jobs. Dean and I rode around with him because it was snowing and the mud was thick. Bob and Dean Rowe finally wound up going to Texas, and I came back to California, because I hated the cold weather. I bought a ticket as far as I could go, which was Flagstaff, Arizona. I wound up there with less than a few cents in my pocket. I hitchhiked towards California, which was picked up by a man driving a load of Christmas trees, and later by four drunken Indians. I could feel a familiar sense of hostility that might have left me dead in the desert. When I got in the car, there's four drunk Indians in the front seat. So I got in the car with them, and they said, sing something. And they'd stop drinking their whiskey, and they looked at me, and their mouths fell open. A few things come to mind about that ride with the man in the Christmas tree. To back up a bit, there was a big hole in the floorboard. My Levi's were already froze when I got in the truck. And I thought, boy, I'm going to get some warm, restful sleep. And that wind, from all the way from Flagstaff, all the way down to the Colorado River in Needles, California, where it finally got warm, that hole supplied cold air. I later hopped a freight train in Needles, California, later that same day, about five in the evening. I estimated the time between Needles and Barstow to be somewhere around three or four hours. I think I arrived in Barstow about three in the morning. That was where I gave up the hobo life and called my mama. There was no point in calling Leona, because I knew she didn't have any money. I hadn't sent her any, but then I hadn't earned any. All I had was what little I stole, and it didn't last very long. If We Make It Through December was the number one song for me. It's about a man who loses his job in a factory, and he's broke, and he wants Christmas to be the happy time of the year for his little girl. One day I asked him, I said, how's your marriage doing? His reply, well, it'll be fine if we just make it through December. Dana was one year old and my second child, Marty, hadn't been born. Having a baby and another one on the way should have made a happy holiday spirit. But there's no joy in poverty at any time of the year. One night shortly before Christmas, a friend named Mickey came by to visit with Leon and me. We had enough money to feed all of us and the baby and for Mickey and me to get drunk on cheap wine. We talked about the frustration of our situations and the hopelessness of an honest man trying to make an honest living and doing honest work. It was especially outrageous to think that two dishonest men could have such a conversation. I told Mickey about Fred and Gene's, a restaurant owned by Dean Rowe's uncle. It had come to that I was planning to rob the relative of one of my best friends, probably my very best friend. Mickey and I, by then, had probably drunk four or five bottles of that cheap stuff. I took my pregnant wife and a one-year-old baby into the December night with my drunken friend to rob a restaurant. I thought I'd waited long enough for the beer joint-restaurant combination to be closed by now. Time drags when you're worried, and it must have been dragging for me. Time was not the wee hours of the morning, as I thought. I was seconds away from breaking into the back door of a restaurant that was open for business. I was probably less than quiet as I removed the screen door with the crowbar. When I had difficulty, I simply tore the door from its hinges. With the crowbar, I began to pry at the backside of the door. I discovered that when the owner opened it, and recognized me. Gene said, why don't you boys come around the front? Come in like everybody else. Dammit, I was trying to rob the man secretly, and he was being kind and inviting me to come in. The owner stood bewildered as we ran to our car and burned rubber to get away. I wonder what he said when he called the police, probably something like this. You know, you're not going to believe this, but Merle Haggard just tried to break into my restaurant, which is wide open for business. Isn't that funny? We were speeding away in the dark with our lights out. Less than half a block away from the restaurant, a highway patrolman came around the corner, seen us with our lights out, whipped in behind us and flipped on his red light. He knew that we were the guys that made him his living. I had managed to come by a check protector from a place called Russ Taylor's Fire Prevention. I had it between my legs, and when the cops stopped us, there it was, one of the first things they saw. So they knew they had somebody that was planning to do something, or had just done something, or maybe both. Leona and the baby were wrapped in blankets in the back seat. I looked at them as I saw the cops approaching our stopped vehicle. I had gone out to get enough money to finance our Christmas. Now, not only would money be missing at Christmas, so would I. Our car, with their lights on, made a dark getaway area in front of my car. The police had Mickey in back of my car, and we were ordered to sit in the back seat. I assured her cops wouldn't hurt a pregnant woman with a baby. I pulled off my boots and silently rolled out the door. I got to the railroad track just a few feet away and up over the fence into the railroad track and was gone. But the remainder of the night was all I was allowed to stay free. I went straight to my mother-in-law's house and they knew that's where I'd go and they showed up there, arrested me, and I was once again back in jail. As I was being booked by the sergeant, fingerprinted and whatever, a few of the cops passing by called me by name, and I did the same with them. Sergeant Matlock put his hand in the small of my back and began to escort me down the hall to what was known as the hole. I spent it without any clothes on, and I spent the entire night praying and beating the side of the bunk, saying I wish I had just 24 hours to say goodbye to the ones I love because I knew this time I wouldn't be coming home soon. The next day, a parole officer who had been in charge of me all throughout my California Youth Authority escapades came in to say how sorry he was that I was being turned over to the adult authority knowing the charges, he knew that I was headed for big time. But he said goodbye, and he turned me back over to the same sergeant, Sergeant Madlock. And Sergeant Madlock, once again, put the palm of his hand on my back, but this time he led me to a different door. He said nothing, and the other cops didn't say anything either. Maybe they were looking for an excuse to put a permanent stop to the embarrassment. Maybe they were trying to set me up on a repeated offender charge for my multiple escapes. The sergeant walked me to the front door, the main door, the one that goes to freedom. Then I realized the only footsteps I heard were my own. Had he dropped back a few steps? I didn't look around. I walked out of the front door of the Bakersfield County Jail in broad daylight. I could lie to you and tell you some story out of a Zorro film about leaping from top of a building to another top of a building or something. That's about the best way I can explain my talent for escape. I guess I envisioned myself fading into my surroundings. I did it again on December 24, 1957, as I slipped through the crowded hallway full of police officers who knew me by my first name and right out the front door of the Bakersfield County Jail. What happened next, for many years, I would look back and attribute to the answer of a prayer, that same prayer that I beat on the cell door with that night while I was naked. I had prayed for 24 hours on the streets to say goodbye to the people that I loved so much. I made my way to where Leon Copeland was painting cars for a living at Barber Pontiac in Bakersfield. Barber, the owner of the place, recognized me and said, you know what? They're broadcasting your picture on the television. And I said, really? What are they saying? He said, something about dead or alive. Well, Leon took me out to a place called the Lame Duck Motel. And I told Leon, I said, if you can find Leona, go get her, bring the babies, and bring them here. And I said, uh, is there any way that you can come get me and take me in a car somewhere where I can get to a freight train or something? Because I was without a car.",

But I had to say goodbye to my brother Lowell and his wife, and I figured before I left, so there I was on my way to Lowell's against Lomer's wishes. It was getting dark, and I saw some flashlights outside, and I said, Lowell, they're here. I don't guess there's any way I can get away, so just let them come on in.\" Pretty soon they began to knock on both doors. Lo and behold, in the front door came Tommy Overstreet, the very same police officer who had arrested me the night before. I said, Tommy, I've escaped twice in the last 24 hours, and I don't think there's much chance of doing it again. I said, would you mind before you put those handcuffs on me if I had a big shot of this old granddad? He said, Merle, I don't think it'd be out of line at all. He said, in fact, I think I'd like to have a shot myself. And this time they looked up my ass and made sure I didn't have anything. And I spent Christmas in 1957 naked in Bakersfield County Jail. I was sent to Chino Guidance Center, where I would subsequently undergo formal sentencing. What I mean is that Chino was a place where they held you and analyzed you until they knew something about you and knew where you might fit in. Of course, being a young, innocent boy, I figured that they'd probably send me to some minimum security place, you know. I didn't have to worry about places like Folsom or San Quentin or anything like that. And I thought, you know, my next in line would be probably Tracy, would be right after Preston. And I remember that there was a great song written by a prisoner there while I was there. I can't remember the guy's name, but he wrote Unchained Melody while I was in that particular place. I didn't realize just how tired the state of California was of Merle Haggard. I understood the procedure from watching the other convicts get their assignments. I knew that it came on a little thin onion skin, different kind of paper than I'd ever seen before. But you could see through it, and they brought it to you in the wee hours of the morning, something like 3.30, usually while you were asleep. But I imagine that I wasn't the first convict to probably spend the whole night awake waiting on that little onion skin piece of paper. And every time that the keys would move at the other end of the block, you know, you'd jar awake, and you'd say, oh boy, here it comes. Or, you know, what are they going to do with me? It's going to be here in a minute. And finally, when this man walks up and places this little piece of paper in this clothespin, that they put on the bar to replace your mail and that sort of thing. I thought, you know, you ought to get up and see what it says. And the light was just so that it was dark in my cell and there was light outside. And I looked up and I seen this, I thought it said sand. I said, what is that? And I jerked the sucker down and held it up to the light, and it said San Quentin. And I think if there was ever a period in my life in which I grew up, I think it was that moment. Today, as you drive through California, you see several prisons. Back then, there were five famous prisons in the nation. Folsom, Alcatraz, Sing Sing, Joliet, and San Quentin. No matter which one you were in, you'd rather be in the other one. It was just beginning to get dark as the bus pulled up after a 500-mile trip. We looked up at this enormous penitentiary, with lights and armed guards, and the place spread everywhere. It was about 10.30 at night when we finally got inside. I found out later that they brought us through the north block and across the big yard and underneath the canopy. In the east block, on the left, some of the guys were still awake. I could see them staring from the windows and from their different tears. What have I got myself into this time? I mustered in, and I was taken to my first cell, 4B13 in the South Block. 500 men were housed inside a cell house with 250 cells, that were smaller, maybe half as small as those found in the county jail. When I finally got into the cell, I remember thinking, they've got me. The cell was the width of a bunk, plus the span of my shoulders. This particular night in San Quentin, the arrival, the walk through the yard, and being placed in my cell, if I have some way underplayed it, let me impress upon you, it was the scariest moment of my life. Yeah, the trip to San Quentin was every bit as frightening as you might imagine. All I could hope for was that one of them big son-of-a-bitches didn't want to make a girl out of me. And all I could hope was that I had the courage to stand up for myself and not let it happen. Because San Quentin was the place where they sent the biggest and the toughest men in California, the eighth largest government in the world. I guess I tried to be invisible, slip through the cracks. You don't infringe on other people's personal lives, or ask questions, or borrow candy or cigarettes. You never know what else might be going on in a person's life. For example, some guy may have just found out that his boy on the outside is dying of cancer, or something just as bad. You say something to that guy, and he's liable to kill you before he realizes. But I couldn't play in the prison band for two years because I was on what they call close custody, thanks to my escape record. That meant that I was locked up after four o'clock each day. Finally, I was reclassified down to a medium security, which meant that I could play in the warden's band and play on the warden's show once a week, which happened every Wednesday. A lot of people ask me if I got anything beneficial out of San Quentin. Let me say, San Quentin was beneficial to me just as much as the Army was to a soldier. I was 20, full of piss and vinegar, with no intention of doing anything right. If there's a divine intervention, God intervened in my life and threw me in prison for a while. I think just to slow me down, maybe get my attention. A time or two I lay in my bunk and I could hear men crying out in pain from being raped by other inmates. After a short while, I wasn't afraid at San Quentin anymore. I guess you could say that I was institutionalized, some way calloused. I'd gotten used to this place quicker than I thought that I would. I was delighted to find that a man could get almost anything he had the money to buy. Guards could be paid to look the other way also if someone's ass needed to be kicked. Men die in San Quentin for not paying back a pack of cigarettes. I learned the prisoner's unwritten code very quickly. No one ever told me how much time I'd receive in the sentencing. Imagine living in this hell and not knowing when you were going to be getting out. I didn't go to school, remember? The food was sometimes terrible, sometimes it was bad, sometimes it was all right. I had five jobs at San Quentin, and I think I was fired from every one of them. Eventually, I did my best work by doing nothing at all. My true talent took a lot of thought, because it was escaping. But I tried not to fantasize about it in San Quentin. I didn't know exactly how much time I had to go, But I knew I didn't get life, and I knew I was young enough to start over after I'd served my time. I didn't want to blow it by escaping, getting caught and seeing another 15 years or maybe a life tag added to my sentence. Any chance for parole would be denied after such a try. One of the bad jobs I had in San Quentin was working in the prison laundry. Socks were sweaty, and the men sometimes didn't bathe. I developed a fungus from handling the filthy clothes. Soon it was eating right through my own fingernails. Do you know how sensitive the skin is underneath your fingernails? I spent a lot of time at the prison hospital trying to decide what to do about this newfound problem in my fingers. One inmate suggested that I try pissing on my fingers. I was really trying to adjust to the hell that they call prison life. If you were tough, there was somebody there to take care of you. There was a team called the Goon Squad that consisted of four or maybe six men that always took care of the tough guys. My cellmate, for the sake of this story, was named Sam. He worked in the furniture factory with a man named Jimi Hendrix, whose nickname was Rabbit. A bank robber was doing two five-to-life sentences running end-on-end, non-concurrently. If sentences ran concurrently, no matter how many you had, they all counted as one. So this guy was doing at least 10 years and probably more before he came up for parole, which would likely be denied. And because of my reputation, and because of the fact that Sam wasn't interested in going, Sam let me in on the plan. It would mean the place couldn't even hold a little guy from Oildale. But in my mind, I knew all the time that I was never gonna escape with Rabbit or anyone else. But I gotta say that Sam and Rabbit came up with a really good scheme. Sam McCartner was helping to build a desk that would be shipped to the judge, and the plan was to pack rabbit inside. No guard was dumb enough to tear into a desk that was custom made for a judge. The judge might want to know who had messed with his furniture, and the guard might be out of a job. I had many reasons for not going, because we'd be the first escapees to clear the walls in 13 years, and we'd be the subject of a nationwide manhunt. The warden and the governor and the judges would all see to that. There's no way that they'd have the corrections department embarrassed in front of the whole world. So Rabbit vowed that once he got beyond the walls that he'd do anything, anything, to keep from coming back. I knew he liked me enough that he didn't want to see me caught in the crossfire. Rabbit reminded me in front of Sam that I was only 20 years old, young enough to start over with my life. He stressed that if I behaved, I could get out before too long. On the other hand, he'd be at least 40 before he got out. Who'd hire a 40-year-old man with penitentiary listed on his resume? Rabbit had less to lose than I did. He told Sam that I was welcome to come with him, but he advised me to stay. I saw Sam at lunchtime, and he told me that the plan had gone smoothly. The rest of the day, I was uptight, wondering what was going on, wondering if he'd made it. By 4 p.m., everybody in the joint knew something was wrong. It had been 13 years since the successful escape from San Quentin inside the walls. And the men hated the delay of supper, which occurred when the count was wrong. And for 13 years, whenever the count had been wrong, it had been because the guards were too stupid to perform basic arithmetic. And now everybody was laughing again, because they could imagine the warden chewing out these guards over the false alarm. That's what each of 6,000 men, almost to the man, thought. They didn't let us eat that night till maybe 7.30, maybe even as late as 8 o'clock. By the time they fed us the fodder they called food, the mess hall was one big celebration. But the noise of the mess hall was too loud, and not even the guards with the guns turned around. When we returned to our cells, we had little earphones with, I think, a selection of about five channels. and everybody tuned to the news channel to see how the manhunt was going. The newscaster said, Jimmy Hendricks has been identified as the first man to escape from the San Quentin walls in 13 years. The warden and prison officials are confused and bewildered as to how it occurred. There were broadcast updates about the missing prisoner every day for a week. It was as if we were factory workers supporting a hometown boy on the front lines during a war. One man had taken on the entire system, and he was winning. I knew he'd eventually lose, but I never said it out loud. Somebody might have thought I was taking the warden's side. Then one day a program was interrupted for a bulletin. A man thought to be Jimmy Hendricks had shot and killed a California highway patrolman, which stopped him for a routine violation. Patrolman had him surrounded in a hotel somewhere near San Jose. Sam and I both knew that he'd do anything to keep from coming back. When the trooper had asked Rabbit for his driver's license, Rabbit had blown him away, point blank, with a shotgun. But at close range, a man can put his fist through the hole that it will make in a human chest. I truly pray for the man's family, and I hope that he died instantly so that he didn't suffer. Rabbit returned to San Quentin for escaping and for first-degree murder. The state of California discontinued the electric chair by 1958. People ask me all the time about my excellent memory. I can talk about the night I swept the Country Music Association Awards. But I have no memory more vivid than seeing Jimmy Rabbit Hendricks led to his death. They held 30-06 rifles, and he wore leg irons and chains. Now, that wasn't the way they marched him to the death room, or to the death cell. But that was the way they marched him across the yard, back and forth to his attorney. Was he wrong to escape? You tell me after you've done hard time. And you're looking at nothing else but more hard time. who wouldn't even look him in the eye, would each push a button. But no one would know which button actually dropped the sack of cyanide into the bucket. The fall would tear the sack, and the fumes would rise upward into the nostrils of Jimmy Rabbit Hendricks. When a man was executed at San Quentin, it took place usually at 10 o'clock in the morning. and a puff of smoke would be released from the stack above the north block the instant a condemned man died. The stack was in full view of the majority of 6,000 men who stood as silently as Rabbit sat. The warden led a prisoner down the hallway to his doom. I heard him tell the warden just before he reached my cell, let my guitar playing friend do my request. Those words are from Sing Me Back Home, my third number one song, released in 1967. I'd been in the joint for 18 months before I had my first parole hearing. I got the results, and they came the same way that I got my San Quentin sentencing. Someone put a note between the bars, and I stared at it and wondered what was in it. I wish I hadn't even gone before the board, but I had no choice. Maybe I should have told them that I liked being Lord of the State. then probably they'd let me go just to make me unhappy. I live day to day largely for the visitation privileges. Leona came to see me and brought the kids, Mama, she came, Lowell came, Lillian came, and a few others. It was hard to see Leona and not be able to touch her. It seems my wife was going to be blessed with a third child. But there'd been no sexual visitation between Leona and me. She was pregnant with someone I hadn't met, and I wasn't entirely sure of her whereabouts. Someone once said that the worst sickness in the world is homesickness. Homesickness is especially painful when you don't know the location of your home. Work was the best escape I knew, except maybe for alcohol, so I decided to combine them. I didn't have the ingredients, and I hoped I didn't have the time to get the stuff to age. All the ingredients were in the prison kitchen, including yeast. Needless to say, I didn't embark upon the venture, but the blessing of Warden Dixon. I made the brew from stolen ingredients and packaged it in used milk cartons. Selling the stuff earned me a whole lot more than $18 a month, the maximum pay San Quentin was offering. My customers walked around the prison yard freely drinking the beer out of milk cartons. My homemade beer was a lot more stout than the store-bought variety, and it smelled stronger, too. By staggering and falling into the pisser, I went into the toilet about one o'clock in the afternoon. There was a gable off the building inside the upper yard, just off to the right after coming up from the lower yard. There are steps on the right, and then there's a big restroom. Ten or fifteen men were usually out there straddling the toilet because they didn't want to sit down on the nasty things. So I did, and I staggered over to the pisser, drunk. I've been drunk six or seven times in my adult life, but never that drunk. I dropped my cigarettes in the urinal, and then I went in to get them. I moved too fast, and soon I was headlong into the urinal. Everybody in the whole restroom laughed, and the guards heard the laughter, and then here they came. They threw down on me just like they'd throw down on someone in the street. Men who'd whip someone's ass just to stay and practice. That was the goon squad, not to be confused with inmates. I looked up from the urinal in my drunken state of mind and saw this man with a .30-06 pointed at me from the catwalk. I don't think they whipped me, but I had the worst hangover I'd ever had in my life. I got seven days in solitary confinement because I was a drunk in the yard. The Bible was the only thing in the room besides a cement slab where a bed should be. They jerked the mattress every morning at five o'clock and gave it back at nine in the evening. There were no windows, and in the daytime, I read the Bible. My first night, I had no clothes, except for the cotton pajama bottoms. That's hard and cold in any climate, at any time of the year, especially on San Quentin, close to the bay. Through the air vent in the wall, I could hear Carroll Chessman, a convicted serial rapist who'd been on death row for more than 10 years, exhausting one appeal after another. One day, I overheard Carroll Chessman, and he was saying that he'd gotten a life insurance policy in the mail, and that maybe someone had sent it to him as a joke. I talked to Carol six or seven times during my seven days in isolation. I didn't feel like I was qualified to shine his shoes. And I was gonna get out in a few days, you know? I was very respectful to him. He never saw my face and I never saw his, but we kept talking through the air vent. I've read stories about how those seven days on the shelf were the turning point of my life. I'd been living pretty high in the yard, getting away with making beer, and I'd had plenty of money. I used my own money to buy a Martin guitar with 15 cartons of cigarettes that I'd made from running a three-for-two operation, which was a loan company. I wasn't scheduled for another parole board hearing for a while. When I did appear before the panel, my drunkenness in the yard would hurt my chances for getting released. I volunteered for the toughest job in the place, working inside the textile mill. I could do anything I made up my mind to do, and I had my mind made up to get out of San Quentin by way of the textile mill or any other legal route. I didn't know what life on the outside held for me, but I wanted to go see. I know because that was the day I saw the smoke rise from the chimney for the second time. Carol Chessman died vowing that he didn't commit the crimes for which he was being executed. A man who's about to face his maker wants to confess his sins and seek forgiveness. Chessman wrote letters to various people before he was killed. Doesn't that tell you something? I recall last Sunday morning, a choir from off the street came in to sing a few old gospel songs. Those lines are from Sing Me Back Home, the song partially inspired by Rabbit before his execution. The night before Chessman's death, the prison fell quiet. The warden gave the order for Chessman's execution at 10.03 a.m. That afternoon, a dispatch came from the governor's office that would have given Chessman a stay of execution. Leona came to see me in 1960 after the birth of her third child. She wanted to know when I would be going before the pro board again. I went before the same bloodless men who looked like they'd been embalmed while still breathing. And I could hear the paper rattle as they passed the evaluation among them. To my delight, it mentioned the great job that I'd been doing at the textile mill. They couldn't believe that I'd been working, and working at the hardest job in the joint, and working it so well. So they came with all the dumb questions about whether or not I wanted to get out, and what I'd do when I did, and if I'd be a good citizen. Later that day, as always, their decision was on the little onion skin paper placed on the bars. With my forthcoming parole, I'd be out in less than, let me count, 90 days. I could see light at the end of the darkest tunnel I'd ever entered. There's where you have to sprint by pulling determination from deep within. The night before I was discharged, I laid down, but it was fruitless. There is so much time to talk and so little to talk about. My last meal was the first time I'd seen a group of prisoners with a tear in their eye. I was gonna miss these guys, and I felt like they'd miss me, too. I told them that someday I'd come back as a recording artist and do a concert. I even walked through San Quentin with Merv Griffin on one side and the late Eldon Chamlin on the other, with Lewis Talley, some of my band members, and I took them to my old cell. They couldn't believe how tiny and cramped it was, and neither could I. I walked out of San Quentin the day of my release wearing paper shoes, One by one, I passed through each gate. I stood before the looming bars, and a guard in a tower pressed a button that opened each one. I had heard the same sick groan of the electric opening when I'd come into the joint, and had nearly thrown up. I looked around and all I needed was Leona, but she was nowhere in sight. During her last visit, she'd made me promise that we'd make the marriage work when I was released. I'd run into their waiting arms and we'd start the rest of our lives. It was non-existent that November day outside San Quentin. I walked slowly down the sidewalk looking for some sign of Leona and the family. I thought maybe somehow or another she'd been inside there waiting for me. One of the guards from the gun tower looked down and said, are you not going to leave? You're just going to hang around, huh? I said, well, I'm waiting for my wife.",

      "content": "He said, well, I haven't seen anybody this morning yet. I was standing, staring down the sidewalk, wondering what could possibly have happened. And about that time, a woman pulled to the curb in a luxury sedan. The woman was well-dressed and just looked rich, the way some folks do. Bending down, I peered inside the car, which smelled of rich leather and sweet perfume. Would you like a ride somewhere? Maybe the bus station?\" How did she know? I thought, what is this? What's this all about? The woman told me right off that her intentions were honorable. She said she was transporting me because she did that every Tuesday when convicts are released. She said not one of the ex-convicts had harmed her and that each had been appreciative. She said she was very wealthy and that this was her way of giving back a little. So we rode, me in this ill-fitting suit and $15 in severance pay from San Quentin and her in this fancy car with fancy clothes. While waiting for the bus, I went across the street to a bar, walked in and ordered two double shots of vodka. They also had some package liquor there, and I bought a half a pint for the ride. As the bus pulled out of the station long after the woman had disappeared, I thought, I can't believe this really happened. Was that a dream? Was it real? Maybe she was an angel. Headed home, riding a Greyhound bus through the valley that I love so much. I didn't realize at the time that all the steam engines were gone, but I didn't notice any. And I saw that some of the camps where Leon and I'd lived were no longer there, such as Crown's Camp just north of Bakersfield, was gone. Although the scenery had changed, perhaps I'd changed more. Time, particularly time spent behind bars, transforms a man. Leona had failed to show up for my release from prison, claiming she'd had car trouble. I was sure that she, Leona, and my brother Lowell, and my brother-in-law Bill, and my sister Lil, and my mama would all be there as part of a welcoming party. If they'd wanted to see me as much as I wanted to see them, I think they would have been there. As I stepped off the bus, the entire party was not there. But my brother Lowell and his wife Fran and my Aunt Flora were there to greet me. It was something to hold a woman close to you, even if she wasn't your woman. Lowell and Fran and Flora took me to Mama's, where I ate from her bountiful table. It wouldn't have been hard for her to figure I'd be staying with either Mama or Lowell, but she didn't come to either place. It must have been the third day home before I located where Leona lived. It was quite some ways from where my brother's house was, so I asked to borrow his car. Of course, I didn't have a driver's license, and he knew it. He said, but I can't let you borrow the car with no license. They'd catch you, they'd send you back, and me with you. So I walked about 15 miles, sure enough, in a little place called Rexland Acres, just south of Bakersfield. Leona was living there with my two children and the new son, Jamie. How could I have been judgmental about a child who'd had no say about when he was conceived or by whom? Let me say this, as truthfully as I've said anything in this audio book. I tried to love the seventh, and recently I've come to realize I love them more than I know. I forgive their transgressions against me, and I pray they forgive mine against them. I don't want to spend the future regretting the past. My children are welcome to be as much a part of my life as they want to. Speaking of children, Leona was pregnant again within days of my release. Condoms were expensive, and I've never liked them anyway. Leona may or may not have wanted me back as a husband, but she did need a breadwinner. Maybe that's why she decided to give the marriage another go. I went to work for Lowell, earning $80 a week digging ditches. $80 a week was a vast improvement over the $18 a month at San Quentin. And although I probably could have earned $80 or more with my beer concession, the prison officials had shut me down. Of course, I instantly began to hope for a job playing music. People talk about it's hard to find a job looking out your window, but that's exactly what happened to me. He introduced himself, and he said, we have a band, but we don't have no band leader, no front man. Is that true? I was somewhat set back with this, and I said, well, come on in. And he said, what kind of guitar? And I said, well, I play a Fender. He said, no, I mean, what style? And I said, well, I do single string lead. What kind of guitar do you play, Jack? Are you a guitar player? Yeah. I said, man, that ought to work pretty good together. He said, are you a singer? I said, well, let me play you something. I had an old wire recorder there, and I turned it on. I just recorded a song called My Rough and Rowdy Ways. He listened to that, and he looked at me with apprehension and said, that's Lefty Frizzell. I jumped at the chance, because I finally had a chance to do what I always wanted to do, or at least try, to make a living playing guitar. It wasn't long before I was playing in all the nightclubs in Bakersfield. It was so exciting to play in a band with the steel guitarist Fuzzy Owen, the guy from Tally Records who had indicated I sounded too much like some other people. I knew he was still a big shot at Talley, and I thought being around him could help change his mind. He had his own local television show, he had his own restaurant called Lewis Talley's Cafe. He hosted a Saturday night dance over in Ridgecrest, and as I've said, he owned his own record label. Maybe what I've just said indicates that I had all this in my mind, that this was all a plan, but it wasn't that way at all. I was simply trying to make a living, add a few bucks and put a few beans on the table. I soon developed a following, playing these joints around Bakersfield. Buck was a big star, thanks to Under Your Spell Again, Above and Beyond, Excuse Me, I Think I've Got a Heart Egg, Act Naturally, and of course others. His biggest hits, such as Love's Gonna Live Here, My Heart Skips a Beat, Together Again, they were all yet to come. Unexpectedly, he called me one night at the blackboard while I was working and said, would you like to go on tour and replace a bass player for me? He said he quit at the last minute. I said, who is this? And he said, this is Buck Owens. I'm not a bass player, but I'll try to do the best I can. I was earning maybe as much as $150 a week in my seven-day schedule. My work with Buck, which required me to drive an old camper that we'd borrowed from cousin Herb Henson, front the band, play bass, paid $75 a week. I found out after the fact, the way Buck figured it, it was worth $75 a week to me just to be working with him. While on that tour, which only lasted about two weeks, Buck came to the band and he said, boys, we got to name this band. Has anybody got any ideas what we should call the group? And I said, how about the Buckaroos? He said, that's perfect. I learned a lot of things, including what it was like to sing for maybe 17,000 people. We were playing Milwaukee Baseball Stadium with Buck when he broke a string and turned to me and said, saying something. I was only 18 months out of prison and green as a gourd. I'd done seven years in reform schools and finished out with a stay at San Quentin. But nothing was quite as frightening as facing that audience that night in Milwaukee. And would you believe I got a standing ovation? 17,000 people went to their feet for a kid from Bakersfield they'd never heard of before. I'd met George Jones earlier when I was playing at the Blackboard. He'd heard me singing and got drunk and wouldn't come on stage. Somebody told me later that night, George said, who is that guy? Don Markham, my saxophone player of today, was working there at the Blackboard at the time. And he said, oh, that's some kid who just started to work here. That's the best singing I ever heard in my life, George said. That sounds like maybe it might be a made up story, but that actually happened. If you don't believe it, check with Don Markham and George Jones. When I got that standing ovation in Milwaukee, I feel sure that Buck was jealous, because he acted like it. He was the star, and he never got a standing ovation on the entire tour. After the show, Jim Reeves, the program's headliner, a giant star in America, approached me, and he said, I believe that's the best job of singing I've ever heard in my life, and stuck his hand out and shook my hand. Little did I know that night that he would die in a plane crash later that year. My music career continued to progress in the early 1960s. I landed a job on Cousin Herb Henson's television show, and that's where I met Bonnie Owens, who would later become my wife, and would sing harmony for the next 30 years on my touring shows. By now, I was playing seven nights a week, and I was playing Cousin Herb's television show every day. Suddenly, people in Bakersfield didn't treat me like Merle Haggard, the truant, the escapee, or the ex-con, which I still was, and I was on parole. No amount of money could ever lure me back to crime. Leona and I may have gotten along better during that period than any other. Of course, she complained about having to earn so many white shirts. But I was pumping more money into the household than we'd ever had. When my daughter Kelly was born, it did little to improve the quality of my marriage life. Leon and I weren't fighting as much, but we weren't doing anything as much. It's been said that the opposite of love isn't hate, it's indifference. One night as I was about to walk inside the Lucky Spot and start the shift, Dean Holloway pulled up in a brand new car as he always had in those days. And he said, hey, you know what? I'm going to Las Vegas to see Roy Nichols and Winn Stewart. He was hot property in those days with hits such as Wishful Thinking, Wrong Company, Big Big Love. Four or five hours later, we arrived in Las Vegas in front of the Nashville Nevada Club. When I walked through the swinging doors, the first thing I saw was Roy Nichols and that double-neck Mozart guitar that had a metal back on it and a picture of a man flipping a bird. He flipped it up and flipped me the bird and said, come get this son of a bitch and let me go take a leak. I thought to myself, I wonder if that's Ralph Mooney on the steel guitar. Me, sitting in with Ralph Mooney? Gosh, that must be... I insisted to Roy that, hey, look, I better not try this. I knew I sang better than I played, so I did a couple of three songs. On the last song, I noticed Winn Stewart standing in the middle of the dance floor with his arms crossed, looking at me. When I finished my set, Winn asked if I'd been working anywhere. I told him that I was working in Bakersfield with Lewis Talley and Fuzzy and all those boys and doing Cousin Herb's show. And Winn said, how about going to work for me? I said, well, I've already got those jobs there. He said, we'll pay you $225 a week to play bass in front of the band when I'm not here. I said, first of all, when I don't play bass well enough to play in this band. And it surfaced early on when I began playing in Las Vegas. The job was the best job I'd ever had, but the gambling just wasn't going to work. I had to quit Win Stewart and go back to Bakersfield, where there were no 21 tables. In those days, my work in a casino was as bad an idea as a drunk working a tavern. I earlier mentioned my whereabouts when some famous events occurred. I can also tell you exactly where I was and what I was doing the first time I heard my first record on the radio. I'd just gotten off work at the Blackboard Club, and I pulled into my driveway, which was only a couple blocks away, and it must have been around 3.30 in the morning. It's a big deal to me, because I was turning the dial, hoping to hear my song, when a man came on and said, Here's our pick of the week at KRAK in Sacramento. The song was the best thing that had come out of my brief time in Las Vegas. He'd written this song for himself to record on his next single, but he gave it to me. Some people ask me, why did Winn Stewart give you that song? I said, well, I got him in a squeeze play. I asked him one night just before we started to open the curtain, I said, when would you make me a star if it was within your power to do so? And he stopped and he looked at me and he said, why, of course I would. He said, how? I said, let me have sang me a sad song for my first release. He paused and he looked at the floor and he looked back at me and he said, you got me. The record was by no means a monster, as it only appeared on the charts for three weeks, but I was a new artist. Playing an international venue like Las Vegas had done much to reduce my stage fright, but I couldn't stay because of the temptation to gamble. I'd often spent all of my earnings and all I could borrow One time I called mom and told her a lie that I'd been robbed. She wired me some money, then I gambled that away too. I remember Lewis Talley running my Keno card for me while I was playing 21. That meant that I had a hired hand running my Keno card for me. Time Magazine reported that I once lost $80,000 in a blackjack game. Truth is, I won $17,000 in that game and $85,000 playing Keno while Louie was running the ticket for me. As my music began to catch on, I began to worry about my history as an ex-convict. How would my career be affected when folks found out that I'd been to the joint? And how would they find out? Would a reporter break the story? Would someone who I'd known in prison be sitting in the audience and tell everyone in the room? with a disc jockey, break my record on the air, and vow to never play another. Under the terms of my parole, I wasn't supposed to play in a bar, so I told bandleaders that I worked for not to call me by my name when they invited me to the microphone. There were lots of reasons to keep quiet about my past, but not lots of ways to do it. To my surprise, my parole officer gave me permission to leave the state, I think the California parole office saw that I had possibility. Or maybe California was glad to get rid of my trouble-making ass. In their way of thinking, they had pawned me off to Nevada. I'd done everything I could do to keep my past quiet. When we met John in June that day, we sat down to discuss the show. And John said, you know, Haggard, I know you've been to prison. And I think the best thing could ever happen to you would be if you'd let me tell the folks of America that you've been to the joint. I said, oh, Cash, I said, man, I don't want to do that. He said, if they find out in some tabloid, it's going to be bad on you. He said, let me tell them about you, how you had the courage to come forward. They say you can get away with anything except lying to a country fan. He'd schedule to make up the show, get drunk and miss that one too. He always told the fans that he was drunk, he was screwed up, He never told them that he was sick. He said, if you told them that Bob was sick, they wanted their money back. But if you tell them that Bob was drunk out on the bus with a blonde, they'd dance away smiling. When Johnny Cash told America where I'd been, things began to happen. Nobody was mistaking me for Elvis, but I'd made Billboard twice with two consecutive releases in 1963 and 1964. Did I mention that my fourth child was born about this time? I guess that shows where my priorities were. I regret daily that my music and career were often more important to me than my family in those early days. I was 35 years old and much different in those days. Including Jamie, we had five youngsters at home in those early 1960s. We were a seven-member household, the head of which had one objective, to explode into the music scene. When you're trying to make it in the music business, you're always looking for a hit song. After you become established, the songwriters start looking for you. I was playing a club in Sacramento one time when Lowell and Fran were living there. After that show, Lowell and Fran introduced me to someone they'd met during the show. Liz wanted to cook breakfast for me, and I told Lowell, I said, really don't have time, you know, I need to go on. And he said, well, Bud, she says she has some songs, and, you know, she might have some good songs. In my mind, I didn't think there would be any good songs. I just figured maybe we could have some good breakfast. Right after breakfast, Liz got on this funny-looking pump organ and started playing these great songs. She played, My Friends Are Gonna Be Strangers first. A couple of years later, Liz gave me another song called The Fugitive. We had to retitle it because of the popular television series at the time with David Jensen. In 1998, Capitol Records released a box set of my work, recorded from 1964 until 1994. It was called Down Every Road, the first line from The Fugitive. Everyone will always associate Folsom Prison Blues with Johnny Cash and Devil Woman with Marty Robbins. and hopefully they'll always associate me with The Fugitive. I always perform it, and I always take pride in my first number one song. The disc jockeys, and more important, the fans, knew my name. One of the reasons I wanted to be a musician is so that I wouldn't have to get up early in the morning Nightlife was my way of life, just like it says in Willie's song. In the early 60s, Bonnie Owens was dating Fuzzy Owen. The three of us were infected with songwriting fever. Sometimes we'd miss words, and we'd never find them again. We later talked about how much fun it was during those innocent learning days, if you know what I mean. We'd created so much commotion with our three tally records that one day we got a call from Capitol, Capitol Records. Tim Nelson was on the phone wanting to know if we'd be interested in a Capitol contract. After all the many times we'd been down there, on the doorstep, begging for just that. After finishing a tour with Waylon Jennings and Bobby Bear and Hank Snow, Fuzzy and Bonnie picked me up at the Los Angeles International Airport at the end of the tour. I couldn't wait to get to the house and see Leona and the kids. Our house May not have been a mansion by a lot of folks' standards, but compared with the little houses that men Leona had been living in, it was like Hearst Castle. Bonnie and Fuzzy waited at the curb to see if there was anyone home. Debris, filthy diapers, and little bitty paper that looked like about the size of a postage stamp. had been cut up, looked like with scissors, all over the house and then looked like a small tornado had blown it everywhere. There was no sign of life, only signs of where life had been. My wife had obviously left me and taken the children. Why? Why now? Why after all those years of struggling and fighting, far and with each other, had she suddenly departed when things were going our way? Was she someone who couldn't handle success, or more precisely, was she someone who couldn't handle mine? I mean, my God, she knew what I was doing and where I was. It wasn't right for her just to leave after staying with me through all the hard times. I asked Fuzzy to drive me to Leona's mother's house. I was rude as only a young, hot-tempered kid from the streets would be. Fuzzy was my friend, and he'd never seen my temper before. Besides, he knew that my fit that day was not directed towards Bonnie or him. When Bonnie and Fuzzy saw the car, they didn't want me to go inside. I assured them that I was only going to go inside for my keys, not for Leona. As I walked past the parked car, I happened to look inside. The dash was caved in, and much of the instrument panel was lying on the floor. I only knew I'd worked long and hard for that pretty 57 Chevy, and that I'd left it in Leona's care while I worked some more. What had happened to the most valuable material possession we owned? And why did she let it happen? I bolted into the house where Leona was standing with a man. What are you going to do? You're not going to whip my ass because my boyfriend's here? The word boyfriend in connection with a man's wife strikes an emotional chord. I didn't want my wife proclaiming she had a boyfriend. A tired and jealous man hearing his wife with a history of cheating talk about her current affair will cause you to lose control. I don't remember much, except that I whirled around and went for her throat. I knew exactly where I'd be, and exactly where I was gonna be. I felt Fuzzy's hand on my arm, and reality began to come back into view. She was alive, but in the space of those moments, my love for her had died. I picked up my kids at the babysitter's home and took them over to my mom's. I remember thinking at the time, she'll hurt nobody else. As my life began to settle down after our separation, Bonnie began to tell me her troubles. My best friend, Fuzzy Owen, and her had been going together for some 15 years. I knew Bonnie was convinced that Fuzzy was seeing another woman. But still, that was none of my business and had nothing to do with the wrong things that I did coming up. Some 35 years later, the other woman, I might say, who is a great friend of mine, is still married to the great Fuzzy Owen. Neither Bonnie nor I, nor for that matter Fuzzy himself, could have predicted what was about to happen. Fuzzy and Bonnie and I became inseparable, but I found myself becoming increasingly drawn to Bonnie. Since I wasn't on tour, I didn't need a harmony singer or a band, but Bonnie was working every night somewhere. She knew that I had the hots for her, and Fuzzy was cheating on her. So she said goodbye to both of us and took a job in Alaska. They say absence makes the heart grow fonder, and that's a worn-out phrase that wouldn't be worn out if it weren't true. I went to the barrel house where Fuzzy was working in the band, and I asked him if he'd let me have Bonnie's number, and he gave it to me. I returned later to ask to borrow some money from him. I didn't tell him what I was gonna do with the money. Then I used the money I had borrowed from Fuzzy to fly to Alaska to see his girlfriend. Bonnie sensed what was going on when I called her, when I told her I wanted to work in Alaska. She was going to be working in Alaska for the next four months. And I knew that she had an in there and maybe could get me a job playing guitar. Bye.\" When I stepped off the plane, Bonnie was there to meet me. And she had her boss with her, a fellow named Joe Cheeks. On the way into Fairbanks, old Joe promised me temporary employment. And at the end of the night, Bonnie and I went to separate rooms. Later, I lie in bed in the land of the midnight sun. and thought about this beautiful woman in the next room. It's so thrilling at the beginning, when the relationship requires no work, but generates such a passion. One of the most thrilling moments in my life occurred that night, as I saw Bonnie undress in the moonlight.",

      "content": "In the spring of 1965, Leona Hobbs Haggard gave me a divorce. My mother had gained custody of my children in court. On June 28, 1965, Bonnie Owens, the former wife of Buck Owens and former girlfriend of Fuzzy, became my lovely wife. And I hurt for him, because I truly loved Fuzzy at the time. My mother and Bonnie Owens helped me raise my four children as if they belonged to them. Bonnie was an excellent mother and an excellent homemaker. On November 18th, 1968, Capitol released a song called Sing Me Back Home. Everybody thought it was gonna be a big hit, even my publisher, which at the time was Blue Book Music, a company owned by Buck Owens. I needed $15,000 since I owed five grand to some heavyweight Vegas gamblers. So I went to Buck for an advance against my royalties. After a, ha, ha, ha, ha, he said, I'm not a loan company. We argued back and forth, but he said he wouldn't budge unless I sold him half the song. while he got half the song, which was based on my experiences in San Quentin. Buck would earn his half of the money from sitting behind a desk. Let me add, there was a check at that moment in Buck's desk that would more than cover what I needed. Buck wasn't the first or the last to show me that the music business is more business than music. and that the business, unlike music, isn't always a pretty melody. A singer's most significant milestone is getting a recording contract. Probably the second most important would be getting his own band. The first person I hired was Roy Nichols, the little guy from Fresno that I idolized all my life. I drafted Roy from Las Vegas when he'd left Winn Stewart's show. Winn paid him $250 a week at that time, and he was so fed up with Las Vegas and the slot machines that he agreed to work for me for $125 a week. He said, I don't drive, I carry my own amplifier, and I want to know where my place is to sleep. He said he'd sleep anywhere, even on top of the instruments, as long as he knew that that was a place he could rest every time he got tired. He's without a doubt one of the greatest and most mimicked guitar players in the entire world, and definitely one of the greatest I've ever known closely. Until the late 80s, every successful country singer had a signature instrumental sound. You have no idea what an honor it was for me, then, and until the day illness forced his retirement to work with the great Roy Nichols. I've never known anyone that misunderstood each other more than me and Roy. Roy was always a perfect gentleman, but one time Roy was playing guitar in Buck Owen's studio during a recording session. At the end of the session, he and Buck had some words. As Buck turned to leave the studio, Roy hurled a solid body fender guitar that belonged to Buck directly at Buck. The door closed and the guitar hit the door just as it closed. I don't think Buck ever said anything out of the way to Roy after that. By the way, that old Telecaster guitar was still in tune when it hit the floor. In 1966, I bought a house at the mouth of the canyon just outside Bakersfield that became famous. An enormous quarter-inch scale railroad ran through so I could feed my fascination for trains. A lot of magazines carried this story, especially Life. The same year, when I was 29, I was riding a horse on my property. The horse threw me, I broke my back, and I crawled about 300 yards to the highway. I wish there had been more to the story, but that's about it. The doctors misdiagnosed me for five months, during which my back began to heal improperly. I worked shows the entire time and was actually relieved to find that the pain stemmed from a broken back. When you're carrying that much pain for that long with no idea of the cause, it's frustrating. The hit records were coming consistently by the late 1960s. And that's one of the reasons it's hard to achieve longevity in music. People began to expect great product from a recording artist. An artist can record 20 number one records and miss on a couple, and the record label will be whispering about dropping him. In 1968, I had a number one record for two weeks with The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde. The song was a hit I knew because of the runaway success of the movie Bonnie and Clyde, starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway. Faye called me one night to say how much she enjoyed my song. And as she spoke, I could hear music in the background. The tune was Today I Started Loving You Again, the B-side of Bonnie and Clyde. It has been recorded more than 400 times by other artists and has been number one at least twice. I was at Nashville's old Ryman Auditorium rehearsing for an evening show, I think for Kraft Music Hall. His pace was slow and his shoulders were slightly slumped, but the smile on Bob Will's face was still radiant. I'd met him a few times, and once later on, I even threw a party for the original Texas Playboys at my own home. We even put up a sign in front of the house that said, Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys appearing tonight, one night only. On that day at the Ryman, he and his guitar player Tag Lambert approached with little fanfare. He spanked me lightly on the cheek, much as the Italian folk do. I don't have a full band anymore, he said, as if I didn't know that the greatest, largest Western swing band in history had been disbanded. We travel around the country, and we don't pay much attention to the new music. I prayed that you'd be number one, and you're in the top five, so part of my prayers have been answered already. Bob was referring to my current record having risen to number five. Hearing those words after being physically touched by Bob Wills' hand is another one of my favorite memories. The person I wrote it about is actually my least favorite memory. But that song applies in many ways to Bob Wills and his words that he said to me that day. I'd stood on people's shoulders to peek at him when I was just a kid. I even rode a bicycle one time out to Beardsley Ballroom and stood on the bicycle seat where I saw him, Junior Menard, Tommy Duncan, and the entire Texas Playboy Band in 1948. March 25, 1972 saw the release of Grandma Harp, a tune that became my 12th number one song. My sister Lillian later recalls how I had phoned her in the middle of the night for the details I needed to write a song about my maternal grandmother. Lillian, who's a bit more proper than I, wasn't amused when I woke her up with questions that could have waited until morning. I think she thought I might have been drinking a little bit. Four days before the release of Grandma Harp, I received an official document from the state of California. I had had no dealings with the state government since I was released from San Quentin 12 years earlier. The California governor, Ronald Reagan, had granted me a full and unconditional pardon. Every felony, every misdemeanor was expunged from my record. I later appeared on a television show with Reagan, a GOP fundraiser. A lot of Democrats didn't think that someone who sang about the working man's rights, as I had, should try to help a Republican win office. I don't judge a man by his politics any more than I judge a man by his color. Ronald Reagan helped me in a way no one else had and no one else could. When he called me for a small favor, I was more than glad to oblige. I involved myself again with the Republicans in 1973 when I played the White House at the invitation of the late Pat Nixon. Seems she was a big fan of all my records, especially Okie from Muskogee, a number one song for me in 1969 and 70. I got a lot of crossover play on that one due to its controversial content. The song couldn't have been more right-wing, so I was quite surprised when I was invited to appear on the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, a program that was eventually canceled for its left-wing humor. Hmm, I wonder what happened to the First Amendment there. I sang the song on a stool surrounded by a little bitty American flag. The hippie movement was pretty strong in those days, and protesting the war in Vietnam was a way of life, virtually on all college campuses. My song denied the use of marijuana and supported respect for the college dean. Nixon was a champion of law and order and regimentation. When I stepped off the airplane in Washington, a gust of wind caught my hat, sending it rolling down the runway through the grease. I wore it that night to perform for the president at his black tie affair. So I asked him to borrow it, and I wore it for a while. And President Nixon sat approximately three or four feet right directly in front of me. There must have been maybe 300 dignitaries and their wives present. And I started the set off with Jimmy Rogers' classic California blues because I knew the president was from California. And as he smiled, I saw 300 dignitaries and their wives move ever so slightly just forward enough to see what the president's reaction would be to this. I didn't expect the crowd to be as receptive as a Texas honky-tonk, but I didn't expect them to be quite so reserved either. Earlier that day, Nixon had learned that the press had become aware of his participation in the Watergate burglary cover-up. There was a party after our show, but Nixon didn't stay long. One of the funniest stories that I remember in my entire life occurred that night at the White House. Louis Talley, the star of Bakersfield, went on to be what some people might term or describe as my press secretary. Louis had been called the press secretary many times by other people in the group. When we went to the White House that night, it was his desire to meet Ron Ziegler, because Ron Ziegler was the press secretary for the president. Without Louie being aware of his partner's true identity, he went to the bar with a guy that he called Horsefly. And him and Horsefly, Hossfly he called him, Hossfly sat there and they drank and they drank. But Louie kept saying, you know, I wonder if those Marines over there at the bottom of the stairs would let me and you go up and see Lincoln's bedroom. So they walked over to these full-dressed Marines, two of them on each side of the stairs. He said, what would be the chance of me and Hossfly taking a quick peek in on Lincoln's bedroom? And they didn't say a word. Finally, Lewis Talley and Hossfly convinced them that they'd only be up there just for a minute. So here they went up the stairs to Lincoln's bedroom. And that night, Lewis Talley told me the story from there. He said he laid down in the bed and he said, well, boys, I think I've done just about everything in my life that I want to do. He said, I have met the president of the United States, the current president. And he said, you know, if I could just meet old Ron Ziegler, I think my night would be complete. Standing at the end of the bed, Housefly introduced himself by calling Louie Housefly. When Charlie Duke, John Young, and Ken Mattingly flew to the moon back in April 1972 on the Apollo 16 mission, they took my music to play in the cockpit. The rest of that story is that I later talked to Duke at a party at the home of former University of Texas football coach Darryl Royal. Duke told me that two UFOs followed the Apollo spacecraft from Earth to the moon. The UFOs disappeared in seconds after the touchdown. Duke even filmed the objects, but the footage was seized by the federal government as soon as they got back. Usually, UFO stories are second, third, and fourth hand. This was first hand from a man who had no reason to lie to me. In 1964, I was co-pilot of a small aircraft coming out of Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. I'd just gotten clearance to fly and was told by the tower to go on home, Mr. Actually, I was en route from Lone Polk, California, back to Bakersfield. I dozed off, but was awakened by a brilliant light through the rear window of the Cessna 206. The entire cockpit was brighter than the desert at noon. The source of light was coming from behind us, but kept getting closer and brighter. It eventually soared over the top of our little aircraft. Well, did you pick up anything on radar? The pilot pressed. The voice answered, we didn't pick up anything on radar, and we didn't fire anything off. If they had picked up something on radar, I doubt that they would have said so. Because they declined to give any information tells me that we were not up there alone. I don't know what to make of that story, except it's one of hundreds of unexplained things that have happened to me in my life. Do I think the federal government has lied to us about UFOs? I'll answer that question with a question. If the president lies, don't those involved with our nation's security lie as well? After all, the president is the commander-in-chief in charge of national security. After a lifetime of thought, I think that UFOs exist. In 1974, Bonnie Owens temporarily left my touring show again. It was the first of many steps that she would take before easing away from me professionally, and then personally, in a departure that resulted in divorce. The road is a man killer, and there's no measuring the emotional toll it takes on a woman. I never cease to be amazed at the people who think show people live glamorous lives. What the hell is glamorous about a 35-year bus ride? Bonnie got her fill. That woman, Bonnie, had packed my early recordings into mail pouches to send to radio stations. She'd sung harmony on nearly all of my hit records and had played on my stage. She had taken dictation of all of my early song lyrics whenever the inspiration came. A year after leaving my show, Bonnie sued me for separation and eventually for divorce. For a brief time, Louise Mandrell took Bonnie's place on stage. She later went on to star with her sisters, Barbara and Irene, in a network variety show. And today, she owns her own theater in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. I thought and thought about girl singers, and so did my band members. And Ronnie Reno was the first to suggest the woman who eventually became my third wife. I had earlier heard her recording voice, but I'd never seen her. So Ronnie set up a meeting at a restaurant on Nashville's Music Row. She came by the studio next day when I was recording, and I asked her if she sang harmony, and she said she would. Dolly Parton happened to come by also at the same time. A lot of folks in the room aware of my interest in each woman said they felt the tension. My future third wife and I soon began to tour and sing together, and it was like my other courtships and marriages. We argued like tigers before and during the marriage. I could talk all about our courtship, breakups, wedding, ceremony, and life as man and wife, but I don't want to do that. I can't remember what she even looks like, and I'd just as soon move on right here. I made a resolution I'd never again be used to further someone's musical career. Debbie Parrott worked at Silverthorne Resort and Marina because her sister and brother-in-law were owners of the business. One of the most beautiful women I've ever met in my life. Boosting my spirits wasn't within her job's description, but she tried anyhow. She wasn't required to wash my clothes, but she did it anyway. She even washed the clothes of my guests on the boat. I can remember seeing her smiling in a crowd, knowing that she was someone I'd like to be with, and she wasn't a singer. by the pool at the house I had bought for wife number three. We just wanted to start our life with a new morning. I think we both knew the same day that our wedding was a mistake. I loved Debbie, and I still love Debbie, as a friend. More like a sister, but not romantically any longer. So when people ask how long we were married, I often say, only one day. In 1984, I was dating a girl named Sabrina, regularly. In the next year, I began to see a woman named Teresa. She was soon to be my wife and give me a family and another chance to be a dad. I guess Debbie helped me the most during the death of my mother, Flossie. We had just pulled into a town in Arizona, perhaps Phoenix, for a show when we got the call letting us know that Mom was near death at a Bakersfield medical facility. I canceled the show, and Debbie went with me to Mom's bedside. Some of the last words my mother ever spoke from her deathbed went to Debbie. I'll always take care of Debbie and her child should they need help. She was catapulting with what was diagnosed as pneumonia, trying to pass away, trying to die. And someone whispered in my ear, if she only had a Valium, she could probably die easier. I think it was somewhere around midnight when I called the doctor and woke him up. And I said, you know, I think my mother could go on and die. Relax and go to sleep if she only had a shot of Valium am I right? The doctor paused and he said we don't want any lawsuits. I said nobody is going to sue you if I'm right Would you please give my mother a shot of Valium and let her die? And he said give the nurse the phone that decision was mine and Lills and Lowell's And I pray that we made the right decision Mom had been a mother figure to my childhood friend, Dean, who was then my bus driver at the time of my mother's death. A man can hurt too badly to cry, but tears would come in their own time. I had cut an album two years earlier, composed entirely of Mom's favorite gospel songs. It was called For the Mama That Tried, the title play off my earlier hit, Mama Tried. It includes such standards as Precious Memories, Where No One Stands Alone, In the Garden, and Why Me, Lord, the great Kris Kristofferson song. I can't describe the comfort they've given me over the years. Funny thing about show business is that when you're struggling, nobody wants anything to do with you. People will give you their business card and then not take your call. And when you're hot, everybody wants a piece of you. In the mid-1970s, I was asked to do a movie called Centennial. I'll never forget a story that Andy told me during the two weeks I spent with him in his green pickup on that set. He and this big-time director were out on the veranda, drinking and telling stories. They'd been out there about an hour, and most of the conversation had been about Don Knotts. And they needed new drinks, and they started back inside, and Andy said that the old man said to him, by the way, Andy, didn't you do something with Don? Of course, that's funny. See why I don't like people who run show business? They may know something about the business, but they don't know anything about the show. Posing that question to Andy Griffith was like asking Santa Claus if he knew anything about Christmas. I was playing Harrah's Club in Lake Tahoe, probably the most uptown venue a country star could play in the 1970s, with the exception maybe of Carnegie Hall. A particular show that was done in the afternoon was quite different than most shows at Harrah's. Not only the cooks and the waitresses and people that worked directly at Harrah's, dealers and such as that, but it was also for the other entertainers that worked for Harrah's. I was introduced, walked on stage, and the audience applauded as if they were asleep. I was doing my first song, wondering what the hell was happening, when somebody in the crowd jumped up and said, hey, what is wrong with you people? I put my hands above my eyes to shield him from the spotlight. This is the greatest country singer since Hank Williams. You need to be balled out, and I'm a little short nigger son of a bitch that'll do it. Walk off stage and come back and see if these son of a bitches will clap. Bob Eubanks, host of television's newlywed game, was the only concert promoter I worked with for eight years. And I'm proud to say that he's the only one I really ever cared for, and I don't think we ever had a crossword during that time. But I'm proud to say I think he made money on most of my shows. He often said the hardest problem he had was getting me to do the one hour show I was usually contracted to do. A lot of people ask how I write songs and where the inspiration comes from. I'm not trying to avoid complicated answers, just giving an honest one. Eubanks reminded me recently of a song I wrote just before I broke up with Bonnie Owens. He thinks I'm most creative when I'm having trouble with a woman. Eubanks was boring me to death at a business meeting, and he could tell it. I'd much rather have been somewhere fishing or making music. Eubanks, nevertheless, was holding court, going on and on about something, when I said, hold everything. I didn't know until years later just how irritated he was. I guess he'd put a lot of planning into what he thought was an important meeting. He probably thought I had my priorities wrong in wanting to break up this important meeting. Music was, after all, the reason all of us were there. He said years later, he thinks I wasn't paying attention. I've had this melody in my head all morning, I told him. What? He said again, still disbelieving that I would suddenly just walk out. I went out and I came back ten minutes later with Everybody Gets the Blues. I don't like to talk too much about songwriting because, as I say, I have no formula. I've used and abused the gift, but it miraculously remains intact. There are obviously some things that God wants me to say in song. My first single for the label was Kern River, a tune about a river that ran between Bakersfield and Oildale, separating the two cities. I was riding high on the song when I went into another unnecessary meeting. You know, asshole sometimes describes something that can be described with no other word. When I finished with this boring guy, I walked out of his office toward the downstairs lobby, where many of the songwriters were gathered for a party, many of which had come to sing songs for me. As we were headed to the party, this president decides to tell me one more time how much he didn't like Kern River. I had given this guy a hit, my very best, for the first release on his label, and he didn't like it. Music business executives don't know what they want. One of the funny things that happened that day, if there was anything funny, Ray Benson had just signed with CBS and he didn't know that Mr. And he'd been kind enough to drive me down there because my bus wouldn't fit between the CBS office and wherever they'd chose for me to park. Asshole's office, there were some more songwriters just inside. And about that time, he told me once again that he didn't like Kern River. I said, we know I think that's about the third time you've told me that.\" And he come back with a real smart demeanor, and he said, I believe it's more like five. And I thought, well, I've took all I'm going to take. I said, I'm about five times overdue telling you to go get fucked. And I said, and another thing, I understand you let Johnny Cash go from the label yesterday. I said, so you dropped the man that built that chair for you over there, right? Tell me something. Where does a man like you come from? What are your credentials? Can you play a guitar? Can you write a song? How did you get here? He said, I'm an Ohio farm boy.",

      "content": "I know for the people that couldn't get out of the room, I felt sorry for him. I felt sorry for Ray Benson because I knew he didn't want any trouble with Mr. Then I left and made another mistake and went to another label that has no credibility, not even enough to be mentioned in this audio book. Veteran country music singers complain that contemporary radio won't play their new releases. That bullshit label I was on wouldn't even print enough to go to the radio stations. There is nothing more frustrating than to be a recording artist who isn't recording or who, if he is, isn't getting his records released. You might wonder, why did the man sign me to his label to begin with? I wondered that myself. And so after 41 number one songs, the streak was over. Thanks to two indifferent and incompetent record executives, I had but one more number one record, Twinkle Twinkle Lucky Star. Can I still make hit records? I don't say watch me, I merely say let me. Between recording companies that don't want to sign senior artists and those that won't release their products, coupled with radio stations that don't play them, well, it's bad news for veterans. I never thought I'd see such a day in country music. When I was a newcomer, my songs were played right along with the hits of Bob Wills, Lefty Frizzell, Hank Williams, Ernest Tubb, and the giants of the 1940s and 50s and 60s. Country music has long been known for loyalty to those who have historically influenced it. On the other hand, rock and roll has been known for its disloyalty. Rock stars at the time were hot one year, totally forgotten the next. Rock and roll is respecting the veterans, while country music shuns its heroes. Rod Stewart, Tina Turner, Eric Clapton, the Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, Elton John, are only a few of those who emerged in the early 1960s and are getting more airplay and drawing bigger crowds than they ever did. Country music programmers could do better on modern radio. I can understand the absence of us veterans from the airplay list if we weren't so popular. I play for sellout houses in almost all kinds of venues. Among us, talking about the seniors, we probably account for 300 number one songs or more. Yet some new kid with a pretty face and new talent can record one song that reaches the number 50 slot and you'll hear the damn thing all the way across the dial every four minutes. People have asked me which one of all the thousands of shows I've done was the best. It had been a tough tour away from my own private bus. I hardly ever took uppers, but I was tired and I asked some of the guys if they had anything that might help me a bit. Somebody handed over half of what I thought was a Benny or a diet pill. That was the extent of my body's exhausted condition. Half of one of the pills would get me through two shows. And then I'd wind up wishing I hadn't taken that, because it'd be hard to come down. So I took this little half a pill, and not knowing that it was LSD. They say if you tell somebody he's on LSD, his trip will usually be good. I thought the building was 40 feet high and very narrow. I got terribly cold, and they put all sorts of blankets all over me, wrapped me in everything they could find, and I was still cold. My mind was playing tricks on me, and I still had to do two shows. All I remember is that horrible afternoon and finally making it to the microphone and maybe doing about 20 minutes. After the shows, Red Lane grabbed me, pulled me around a corner away from the show, and we headed into a dark diner. I was opening the car door when I heard a man say, get him. I figured they were German shepherds, and they were. They got within inches of me, but evidently sensed what I was going to do, and they stopped short. Well, call your damned animals off, and we'll get out of here, I said. I'll kill him.\" That was the end of the evening of what was probably the worst night of my life. I roared my way right through the 1980s, in fact, running and drugging the nights away, making bad decisions, maybe while under the influence of various substances. The non-stop marathon of miles, music, and mayhem were taking their emotional and financial toll. As I said earlier, I had too often trusted the untrustworthy. The pressures of past debts and the pressures of new ones were overtaking me. After signing the deal with a record company that didn't promote me, the royalties of my record sales and radio airplay dropped off, seriously reducing my income. I had earned maybe $100 million in 25 years, but by 1990 I was practically broke, or at least that was what I was told. Miracles occur in the strangest of places, Willie Nelson once wrote. I was playing at Silverthorne Resort, the joint in which I owned 49% of in 1986, when Clint Strong, then my lead guitar, had met a girl named Teresa. We left town with her riding the band bus with Clint. The moment we met on the bus, there was something between us. I think it was two years before she said anything to me. The band went on slightly ahead of me, a couple of songs at least. And I walked up to her and I said, Teresa? I said, this is my room key. Clint Strong is no longer with the show, and his discharge had nothing to do with Teresa. Teresa Haggard would eventually replace my restless spirit with a peaceful soul. Falling in love with her was the beginning of the end of my rough and rowdy ways. When Teresa reads an account of my outrageous behavior, she throws down the article without finishing. I was absent during my first four children's upbringing. One of my daughters, during the 1997 tribute to Merle Haggard that aired on the Nashville Network, said I had trouble expressing my feelings. She said I never told her I loved her, but that I often picked up a guitar and sang a song to her to let her know that I did. Well, I'm telling her and all my children right here in my own words, I love you. And I regret my part of the wrongs that's happened over the years. Forgiveness for old transgressions is the desire of the day. Today, our four-member family takes time many times every day for a circle of prayer. People that haven't been around me in years probably wouldn't know me. I spend my days chasing bass with my family, not chasing women with my buddies. Freddie Powers says the change is tremendous, but it wasn't abrupt. Before we were married, Teresa and I lived on my houseboat for five years, carefree and free-spirited. The published accounts about our drug abuse is simply not true. There was drug use, but only for a short time was it abused. My children don't have to learn from their mistakes. Teresa and I would cry many times together about the loss of our first child. I was 50 years of age and wondered why God had let me sire a stillborn child. My attitude changed as soon as I laid eyes on the tiny living symbol of our love. It had been a stressful day, and Teresa had trouble delivering. Labor was induced, and the baby finally came by way of cesarean. I think I felt a baptism of change wash over me when the nurse put Janessa in my arms. It brought them to an abrupt halt without even realizing it at first. Teresa was seven months into her pregnancy when I awoke from a dream. But I'd heard this voice just as clearly as I'd ever heard a voice in my life. It said, this child's name shall be Janessa Rowena, the voice commanded. I immediately awakened Teresa to tell her our search for a name had ended. So the first time Teresa ever wrote Janessa Rowena, she did so on scrap paper with an eyebrow pencil. We later looked up the name Janessa, which we'd never heard, in a name book and found that it meant child of God. This may all sound like something out of the Old Testament, but it's true. To me, it's a beautiful story that I tell as truthfully as I told those many that weren't so beautiful. If you get a chance, ask Teresa if she thinks I heard the voice of God, and she'll answer yes without a moment's hesitation. Within six months of Janessa's birth, we were off the houseboat. We were afraid our child might fall in the water and drown. We left it and all our rowdy behavior at the dock on Lake Shasta. But before we made that move, I had to find a place for my family to live. I still had the big house that I'd bought for my third wife, but Teresa didn't want to live there, and I didn't either. I decided to remodel and expand an old cabin on our land. The first day I considered redoing it, I was greeted with a moo. When I pulled up to the front door, a cow was standing in the middle of the front room. I don't think anybody but me saw the place's potential. I worked the spring and the summer of 1990 with contractors, and I wanted our new home to be a surprise. I'm going to leave every day, and I don't want to tell you where I'm going. The workmen and I tore down walls and put up new ones. And we did it all after significant structural changes and rewiring and re-plumbing the place. When the work was nearly completed, I got Teresa in the car and I drove up the back way to the cabin. She'd never seen the place before and didn't know it existed. When I drove up, I said, how do you like it? It's beautiful, she said, not believing her own eyes and not believing it was ours. One turkey took up with the chickens and now oversees them and is the boss. We have that wolf Teresa raised from a cub and she feeds it dog food. The wolf is so tame that it probably couldn't make it in a while. The family and I fish a lot in the ponds and we often eat what we catch. The landscape is thick with roses and wildflowers, wild grapes and berries. There's no place I'd rather be and no people I'd rather be with than my home and my family. She hadn't seen a doctor or taken a home pregnancy test. She just knew she was pregnant, and she knew it was a boy. Having a doctor eventually confirm it was nothing more than a formality. What do you mean we're going to have a son? Are you pregnant? The doctor made the confirmation six weeks later. I wasn't afraid during Ben's delivery as I had been during Janessa's. Teresa again had trouble, and there was another cesarean. They put my last child and youngest son in my arms, and he's been in my heart ever since. At the age of five, Ben Haggard announced that he intended to die in the house where he now lives. Teresa and I got married on our own land in a ceremony performed by my friend Tommy Collins. A few hundred guests came to watch us take our vows as the sun went down. My children only leave home to go to school, and even that may cease in the fall of 1999 when we start a homeschool program. Teresa and I love to see the personalities of our children unfold without the influence of other youngsters. I want my kids to have their own identities, not some of some other child's. I come home off the road with plans to go somewhere with my family, but we rarely leave. After 37 years, I'm doing my farewell tour, and I'm so glad. Lately, we've been thinking about moving to Louisiana, where my band can play almost every night and I can sing whenever I want to. But you know, I heard someone say the other day, if you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans. Morning finds the family and me at one of our ponds after breakfast. Before we leave our house, Teresa always puts on a pot of beans or maybe black-eyed peas. There's something warm and secure about having a pot of beans on the stove. She breaks the ground in the spring with a rototiller and would use a tractor with a plow if I'd let her. On Bended Knee, she plants tomatoes, peppers, lettuce, spinach, broccoli, celery, onions, garlic, corn, squash, black eyes, purple hulls, and watermelons. She tries to can and store what we don't eat for the winter. If someone asked me what I love most about Teresa, I might say I love how she loves me. The woman's every thought is to attend and please her family. She knows I'm crazy about Bob Will's music, so she puts it on the stereo as soon as she thinks I'm up and around. Or she'll rotate it with Bing Crosby, Milton Brown, or Emmett Miller, or maybe Old Lefty. She wants to go on the road trips like old times, even when she knows she has to stay with the kids. In the old days before the children, after dark on Lake Shasta, we used to fish for bass in the nude. I'd be hard-pressed to pick a favorite memory from those made with my family, with Teresa. I've had houses before, but this time I have a home. And I've had wives before, but this time my wife is my best friend and my lover. There are some people who wish they had our place and our land and everything that goes with it, and they almost did. Haggard, the nurse said as she handed Ben to me seven years ago. With my baby in one hand, I held a court paper in the other. It said I was being sued by my creditors for failure to pay my debts. Once again, I was paying a high price for cheap thrills and bad decisions. I was dunned at one of the most memorable moments of my life. Some members of my band were shocked in 1997 when I announced on national television that I was broke. People couldn't understand how I could make and lose so much money in one lifetime. Really, it's none of their business, but neither is much of what I've discussed in this program. I'm not entirely free to discuss my finances because of lawsuits against some of the people who helped squander my money through the conflicts of interest and old-fashioned dishonesty. People have no idea, absolutely no idea how much overhead an entertainer incurs and how difficult it is to monitor the incoming and outgoing cash. It would take a graduate degree in accounting and a staff of professionals just to stay abreast of tax laws. When your performance and travel schedule consumes 80 hours a week, there's no time to address your cash flow, even if you have financial knowledge. I can't get away with filing a simple short form for my taxes. So I hire people to wade through the financial maze. I have freely admitted to squandering money on high times and impulse spending, so I accept my part of the blame. But I'm not passing the buck when I say the main reason for my financial woes is that I trusted the untrustworthy out of necessity. I was too busy making money to have time to manage it. I know many people never understood how Willie Nelson wound up owing the Internal Revenue Service $17 million. It was a lot easier monitoring my money when I was working for $150 a week and had no employees than it was when I was earning $30 million a year and transporting 40 people 500 miles a day. You think about slowing down, but wonder if you'll always be in such demand and remember the time when you weren't. So you ride the rocket as far as it'll go and as fast as it'll take you, at the expense of everything else, including your expenses. Rose Waters has been a source of financial salvation. I bought something for $11 and paid with a credit card. Rose, that's the first time I've ever used that card in my life. She found out that people in my organization who had no official reason for the card had a copy nonetheless. And she was quick to reveal people to me that weren't my friends. On March 15, 1999, I returned to my story's starting place. I thought the trip to Bakersfield might be unpleasant, and it was. I went past the Shell station I'd once robbed by pretending to be an employee. I drove past the grade school I'd attended for seven and a half years before I was expelled. I drove to the intersection where five days a week my mother would catch a bus. I stopped in the intersection and looked at the cracked sidewalks in what was once Bakersfield's nicest suburb. People would have no idea that the grandest lady of them all once waited patiently on this corner so she could work for minimum wage to raise a son who'd eventually piss away millions gambling and bad investments, ex-wives and attorneys, Today, she's a few miles away in a grave, but I could see her standing there waiting for a bus that had long since stopped running that route. There's been talk of naming a boulevard after me in Bakersfield. Me, I'd rather see a bronze statue of my mother, sack lunch in her hand, print dress to her calves. There was nothing there but another run-down house, just an address. It had once been a boxcar, and then the home of James and Flossie Haggard. My first home had ridden the rails before I was ever born, and I suspect It'll still stand after I've been laid to rest. I wonder, could I go through it? My name is Merle Haggard. The young men said they knew who I was and expressed surprise that I was there. They'd heard that I'd been born in that boxcar behind their house. Plywood covered the windows, through which I had marveled at the passing tank trains as a lad. She had taken meticulous care of our home, both inside and out. Flowers had graced the yard, and the lawn was always mowed and trimmed as neatly as a golf course. The driveway to the street was lined with poplar trees. I earned my first money as a child selling nectarines. As I walked through the place, I saw once again the first bathtub I'd ever seen in my life. I walked out back into the washroom, a room that held a ringer washer Mom used every Monday. I don't know why Monday was always wash day for the working class people, but it was. I remembered how Dad had painted the entire interior with a brush. Maybe I'm only talking about two or three hundred square feet, but they were so proud of it. On that March morning, I returned to my old home place. The room that had been mine was covered with felt-tipped sketches of naked women and graffiti. The double bed had a bare mattress that was covered with urine and other stains. I'd been in jails that were less stark and more sanitary. if he could have seen what had happened to the home he worked so hard to build and mom struggled so hard to decorate. They were poor, but they were proud, and their belongings were modest. But they were clean, and they were in place, always in place. The two young men were kind to let me walk through the place. They kept apologizing for its appearance and talking about the improvements that they were going to make someday. They seemed to be good old boys, so maybe they'll get it done one of these days. But it'll never be the wood in the stucco jewel box it had been at the hands of James Haggard. I put my hands on the solid wood cabinets that he'd built with his hands. The old house was humid and it was rainy that morning. For all practical purposes, those cabinets had been exposed to the elements for all those years. Yet not a single shelf was warped, not a single side curved. I drove past China Grade, where Tommy Collins wrote his great song, High on a Hilltop, a song on one of my early Capitol albums. Tommy could see the lights of Bakersfield and was inspired to write that song. On that March 1999 morning, I pulled up to what was once my office in the early 1970s. Some graves lie exactly 200 steps from the front door. I bought the Bakersfield office building in the 1970s. At least four years passed before I walked across the street to my dad's grave. Cancer took him after a long, agonizing effort to live. Bill Ray, my beloved brother-in-law, Lillian's husband, is also buried in the family plot. He was working for the former California governor, Ronald Reagan, when Ronald Reagan gave me my pardon. As I stood above Dad's grave, my mind raced in reverse. I remembered how strong he was, how he smelled of tobacco, how he feared nothing, and how he was so sensitive. How many thoughts can a man's mind process at the same time, I wondered. When it touches your family, it stings as if it's never touched anyone else. I thought about how Lowell had tried to help run my enterprises, and how we disagreed. how I had admonished Mom about my behavior when I was young, and how I'd refused to listen to him, and how much I wished I had of. I thought of the times I'd lied to her, and how proud she was of my success. of the song Mama tried and how she always wanted me to be a gospel singer. My mother was Oklahoma penmanship champion when she was a girl. She wrote in a cursive as elegant as English script. A few months before passing, she wrote her life story in longhand. She said she'd write more later, but later for her never came. My name appears for the first time on page nine, and again on the fourth page from the last. In the second, she wishes I was a full-time Christian singer. That was the long and the short of the discussion about me. Mom's first recollection was of throwing her tiny hand into a hot coal when she was three. Her mother, Zona, was boiling soap in a cast iron skillet. Mom also wrote that she remembered traveling by covered wagon from her native Arkansas to Indian Territory, Oklahoma. Mom as a child lived in an earthen dugout with windows at ground level for their parents, grandparents, and aunts and uncles. Oklahoma is notorious for the torrential rains that flood the flatlands in the spring, leaving the ground as mushy as meal. The water must have turned the dugout into a giant underground mud hole. Mom's autobiography talks about half-naked Indians who rode up to the earthen home on horseback and how her mother feared them and their dress, or the lack of it. Mom remembered seeing a talking bird, a parrot, in 1909 in Atoka, Oklahoma, which in 1977 was the site of the largest outdoor country music concert ever held. In the feature film made from the event, Hollywood spliced in entertainers who weren't even there. Mom wouldn't have approved of that deception and actually thought she was being deceived when she saw that talking bird nine years after the turn of the century. Mom wrote that she remembered fighting mosquitoes and the malaria that they carried, the way someone would fight disease today in a third world country. Her dad, she wrote, bought some patent medicine, probably from a touring medicine man, after being assured that it would cure his malaria. He doubled up on the dosage and went insane and was committed to a sanitarium for a period of four months, she recorded. When mom was six, she saw her grandpa William Harp kill a rattlesnake so long that it dragged on the ground when he slung it over his shoulder. Well, they've never lived in rural Oklahoma, parts of which are just as gnarly today. Standing above Mom's grave, I thought about all the sacrifices that she'd made as a child and a young woman. It seemed so unfair that she had to live that way all the way into young womanhood. and that the best home she'd ever had to that point was a converted boxcar. The following statement isn't very original for a regretful son. I wish I had known her better and appreciated her more. I suddenly just wanted to be home with Teresa and the kids, but we had a show to do that night. I left Mom's grave well before noon that morning and walked past each family plot a final time. I found my way out of that cemetery, perhaps forever, without once looking back..",
