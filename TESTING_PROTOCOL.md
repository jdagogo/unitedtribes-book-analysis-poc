## 📋 MANUAL TESTING STEPS

### Step 1: Load the Interface
1. Open http://localhost:3000/chapters
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Wait for these console messages:
   - "🎵 [PLAYER] Initializing YouTube Player Simple..."
   - "✅ [PLAYER] Player is READY!"
   - "🌐 [PLAYER] window.audioSync exposed globally"

### Step 2: Verify Player Status
In console, type:
```javascript
window.testPlayer.status()
```

Expected output:
- window.audioSync exists: true
- All functions should be present
- Current time and duration should display

### Step 3: Test Basic Seeks
In console, type:
```javascript
window.testPlayer.testSeeks()
```

OR manually test:
```javascript
window.audioSync.seekTo(30)   // Should jump to 30 seconds
window.audioSync.seekTo(60)   // Should jump to 60 seconds  
window.audioSync.seekTo(120)  // Should jump to 120 seconds
```

### Step 4: Test Chapter Navigation
1. Click on "Chapters" tab
2. Click any chapter card
3. Check console for:
   - "🖱️ [CLICK] Chapter card X clicked"
   - "📖 [CHAPTER CLICK] Chapter X: [Title]"
   - "✅ [CHAPTER CLICK] Seek command executed successfully"

### Step 5: Test Word Click
1. Click on "Player" tab
2. Click any word in the transcript
3. Check console for:
   - "📝 [TRANSCRIPT] Word "[word]" clicked at Xs"
   - "📝 [WORD CLICK] Word at index X clicked"
   - "✅ [WORD CLICK] Seek command executed successfully"

### Step 6: Test Navigation Arrows
1. Click the left/right arrow buttons beside chapter title
2. Check console for navigation messages

### Step 7: Test Progress Bar
1. Drag the progress slider
2. Audio should seek to dragged position

## 🔍 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

- [ ] Player loads without errors

## 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### If player doesn't load:
1. Check console for errors
2. Refresh the page
3. Player will auto-recover after 3 errors

### If seeks don't work:
1. Run `window.testPlayer.status()` to check player
2. Try direct seek: `window.audioSync.seekTo(30)`
3. Check console for error messages

### If clicks don't work:
1. Check that player is loaded first
2. Look for click messages in console
3. Try manual test commands

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

1. All seeks execute without errors
2. Chapter clicks change the audio position
3. Word clicks jump to the correct timestamp
4. Console shows clear success messages for each action
5. No "player not ready" errors after initial load
