      // Enhanced cultural context specifically for this passage
      enhancedContext = `In the early 1970s, Robert Mapplethorpe was creating collages that anticipated his later photographic obsessions. His fascination with "freaks" connected to a long artistic tradition - from Tod Browning's controversial 1932 film to Diane Arbus's compassionate portraits of outsiders. The "altarpiece" format was deliberate: Robert was raised Catholic and understood how religious triptychs elevated their subjects to sacred status. By placing circus freaks and outcasts in this holy format, he was making a radical statement about beauty, divinity, and who deserves veneration. This was the Chelsea Hotel era when artists like Robert were redefining what art could be - mixing high and low, sacred and profane, beauty and the grotesque. Remarkably, this actual altarpiece from the show Patti describes has been preserved and is now part of the Art Gallery of New South Wales collection, where it continues to challenge viewers fifty years later.`;
